			<h3>Saskatchewan Artists Web Pages</h3>
			<p>This database was born in 1995, as an adjunct to the annual computer day camp held at the University of Regina. The initiative was the idea of a small number of Saskatchewan artists, whose talents would support students' work in the fertile ground where the arts and technology intersect</p>
			<p>As the site grew, its curriculum also grew to include software maintenance. The artist pages are an excellent example of software that needs care and annual updates. The pages are generally created by students aged 11 to 17.  Some pages experience technical difficulties and stop working. Some pages drift from reality as time and circumstance alter the import of the message. The students learn the importance of maintenance and sustainability in a world of change and limited resources, and acquire some of the skills required to implement what they have learned.</p>
			<p>MSI recognizes the support of TR Labs, as well as the time and resources contributed by the many artists whose co-operation sustains the project. Artists presented here were born, raised in, or currently reside in Saskatchewan, Canada.</p>
