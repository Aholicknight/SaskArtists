      <p align="left">The Emma Lake Summer Art classes could be
      taken two summers for credit and after that you could come
      and audit the classes. Gus Kenderdine, the art teacher at
      Regina College had died the year before I started going.
      First I studied under Fred Finley from Toronto and next year
      Ken Lochhead the newly hired art teacher at Regina College.
      In 1948, when the six week class at Emma Lake was over, Mr.
      Finlay asked several of us if we wanted to take a
      correspondence course from him in portrait painting. I spent
      five summers at Emma Lake and later in the mid fifties. I
      attended several two week workshops under first Shadbolt from
      British Columbia and secondly under Barnett Newman, a New
      York artist.</p>
