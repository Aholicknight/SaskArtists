<p><font color="#33FF33">Roger Ing is an immigrant from China. He came to Canada in 1950 where he became fascinated with such artists as Pollack, 
Goeritz, and Kline. Roger has been an amateur painter since he was a young
child. He then started to adopt and combine western art with traditional
chinese art. After gaining fame around the community, he decided to open
a small caf&eacute; where people could come and enjoy a cup of coffee and
a painting in a relaxed enviroment; a ua relaxed enviroment; a utopia if you will, and that's exactly
why Roger called it the Utopia Caf&eacute;. The utopia then became a country-wide
landmark. If city dwellers had people come in from out of town or out of
province, the first thing that they would do is take their guest to the	
<a href="utopiaCafe.html" style="color: #ff69b4;">Utopia Caf&eacute;</a> for a cup of coffee like no other. The caf&eacute; never
seemed to have a slump until July 1993 when something terrible happened.
The city health inspectors closed down the caf&eacute; at 3018 Dewdney
Avenue because Roger was guilty of severe health code violations. Roger	
was also fined $1,430. Instead of re-opening, Roger decided to sell the	
23 year old building. Roger thought all was lost with his caf&eacute;.	There were still a few glowing embers in the pile of ash we call the Utopia	
and those embers went by the names of Harold McNally and Rod Kempa. They
purchased the shut down caf&eacute; and restored it back to everything
it used to be. The only thing that was different about the caf&eacute;
now was that it was now named the Utopia Rock Hard Caf&eacute;. However,
don't judge a book by its cover because you could still get lunch for under
$10 and if you ask you could get a freshly painted Roger Ing original.
Ing's spirit was like the caf&eacute; and never died. Roger's Utopia may
be gone , but the spirit of the Caf&eacute; lives in Roger's art and in	
the hearts and minds of Roger's legions of adoring fans.
