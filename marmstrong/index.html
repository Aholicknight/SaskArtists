    <p style="text-indent: 30px"> Melody Armstrong is a very talented artist who sepcializes in metal and jewelry, which she also majored during her time at school.
      She was born in 1965 amd grew up near Regina, Saskatchewan and at the age of 5 decided she wanteds to be an artist.
      Melody moved to Calgary in 1995 to attended the Alberta College of Art and Design with Distinction to persue her love of art and graduated in 1999.
      Her style is desribed to be Industrial-Organic due to the fact she works with lots of gold, titanium, and stones.
      She does her best to try and make a statement through wearable art jewelry and sculpting work.
      Her most common resource she uses to make her art is metal as it is flexible but not easy to work with.
      She puts up with the difficulty or metal so that when the final product is finished it is resistant to losing shape and form.
      Melody has won several awards over the years including Jurors' Choice Selections in the international Lewton-Brain Foldform Competitions.
      Melody is represented by the Mata Gallery in Regina Saskatchewan, who showcases a large selection ofher jewelry as well as a few paintings inspired by her jewelry.
