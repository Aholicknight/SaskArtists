  <p style="text-indent: 30px">Melody Armstrong is an artist who
  works in metal and jewelry, who also majored in arts with
  distinction. She was born in 1965 and grew up near Regina,
  Saskatchewan. At the age of five she decided she wanted to be an
  artist. Melody moved to Calgary in 1995 to attended the Alberta
  College of art and graduated in 1999. Her style is desribed to be
  Industrial-Organic due to the fact she works with lots of gold,
  titanium, and stones. She does her best to try and make a
  statement through her jewelry and sculptures. She uses metal as
  it is flexible but still finds it not easy to work with. She puts
  up with the difficulty or metal so that when the final product is
  finished it is resistant to losing shape and form. Melody has won
  several awards over the years including Jurors' Choice Selections
  in the international Lewton-Brain Foldform Competitions. Melody
  is represented by the Mata Gallery in Regina Saskatchewan, which
  showcases a large selection of her jewelry and other
  art.</p><img class="img" src="img/melody-armstrong.jpg">
