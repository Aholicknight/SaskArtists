<center><h1>Metallic Work</h1></center><br>
<p>Pete did a series of works with many different materials, but all having one thing 
in common, creatures drawn in metallic ink.  Pete will never make anything like this 
again in his life, because after he finished this series he became very ill.  His 
illness was due to the toxins in the metallic ink that had gotten in his system after 
hours of being exposed to it.

As in his <a href="port.html">portrait</a> work, the lizards have many of the same line 
qualities.  However, the lizards and bugs take on a more two dimensional quality with 
very intricate designs on the inside.<br>

These are only two buttons out of countless buttons that Pete has done.  The buttons
 are on a very interesting journey so to speak.  Most of them were given away to a couple
 of children.  These children have them hanging on a flag in their house, and whenever any
 of their friends come over, they offer one of the buttons to them.  The buttons travel 
around being given and shared from one person to another.  Other people who have a few 
of them have done the same.<br>
