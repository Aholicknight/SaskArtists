                The first piece of relief work that Pete ever did was carved with hand carving tools. Since then, he has started using an electric hand rouan electric hand router. In his relief work, his use of line is used more to define shape than form.

                </tr>
            </table>In Pete's collection, there are a few of these faces with the eyes and mouth cut out. It's interesting to see that these faces are not centered on the piece of wood. This is a good example of what makes this art special. It does not rely on the conventions of culturalhe conventions of cultural art. These relief faces also have a lot more detail inside the face than the faces in the <a href="port.html">portraits</a>.

            </center>This is one of Pete's latest endeavors. These pieces are a series of pieces of wood with relief on them. Right now each is seperate, but there could be a project in the future that puts a lot of them together!
