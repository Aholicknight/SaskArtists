      <p>Martha Cole was born in 1946, in Regina, Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>Most of Martha's art is done with mostly fabrics.</p>
      <p>Most of Martha's inspiration comes from nature, community, and spirituality, having a lot of detailed works of trees and leaves, and many works with elevators.</p>
      <p>Martha decided that she was going to be an artist at the age of 14. She then went into the field of fine arts in sculpture.</p>

      <p>She started by making giant sculptures using metals and welding them together.</p>
      <p>She realised that her projects were too large scaled and expensive while living in an apartement, so she started working with fabrics using a normal sewing machine, making her first work quite difficult.</p>
