        </div>Carving, welding and modelling are all used with skill and precision to create these versatile works. Inspired by movement and the individual materials themselves, coral, marble, metal, granite and modelling clay take a unique and individual style.

        No particular influence or school of thought is obvious, nor does the artist make reference to one "art movement". Only his own imagination can account for the inspiring vision of his works.
