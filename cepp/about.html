                    Carole Epp is a Saskatoon artist born in 1978. She was educated in Red Deer Colorado and Australia. In addition to her numerous writings, Carole combines both the craft and art of ceramics. The Practical domestic pottery displays her skills with industrial forms combined with clean smooth glaze. Her function output is most often presented as collections challenging uniformity, symmetry and inter-lockability. Perhaps her most memorable output are collectable figurines of a disturbing nature were Kitsch and childhood are clashed against terror degradation and perverse technology
