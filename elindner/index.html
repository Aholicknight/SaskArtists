      <p>Earnest Lindner was born May 1st, 1897 in Vienna, Austria.
      In Earnest's younger years he was a lieutenant in the Joint
      Austrian Air-force from 1915 to 1918. He worked as a bank
      clerk and in his family's walking stick firm until his
      emigration to Canada in the 1920s. He started out teaching a
      night class at Saskatoon Technical Collegiate until 1931,
      then he finally became a full-time instructor and Head of the
      Art Department (1931-1962). He returned to Austria to take a
      Master course in etching and stone lithography at the
      Akademie der Angewandten Kunst of Vienna (1959). Earnest
      Lindner was very active in the local, provincial and national
      arts communities. In Saskatoon he was in a discussion group
      called "Saturday Nights" and it was an art group that met
      every Saturday Night and the art group was usually held in
      Earnest's home. He was a member and a President of the
      Saskatoon Art Association, one of the first members on the
      Saskatchewan Arts Board and he was in a group called
      "Prospectors", the first group of Professional Artist's in
      Saskatchewan. From the year 1962 to 1988, Earnest worked
      full-time as a artist and was known for his engraving and his
      watercolours.</p>
