    <h1>About Mark Sexton</h1>
    <p>Mark has been interested in art all his life, be it drawing
    or painting. He has not made a living off of his work, but he
    still pursues it. When computers came around, he experimented
    with them and found it very gratifying to be able to make
    wonderful things very quickly and colourfully - and the ability
    to delete what he didn't like was a bonus. One of his early
    problems was that there was no easy way to share his media. He
    would have to print out the pictures. He loves the idea of
    mixing digital and traditional art, and Photoshop expanded his
    ability to do so.</p>
    <p>He loves art and its aspects, and he also loves his wife
    very much.</p>
    <p>Mark studied under Robert Bateman and spent some time in
    Italy studying art.</p>
