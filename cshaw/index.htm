    <h3>Christine Shaw - Artist Statement</h3>
    <p>My work emphasizes a phenomenological approach where modified architectural environments solicit a heightened level of somatic participation on the spectator's part. The spaces I construct become large membrane-like participatory environments--made from materials such as translucent stretchy fabric, industrial rubber, plastic, and guy wire-which require activation by the participant to give it full meaning. These environments re-engage us with the world in a visceral way therefore challengin institutions which privilege physical distancing and social divisions. Form and content are synthesized as participants journey through the sculptural passages, creating and transforming its composition, while it has the resilience to bounce back to its original, autonomous state. This interaction between object and subject raises the connection between viewer and artwork to an intimate level.</p>
