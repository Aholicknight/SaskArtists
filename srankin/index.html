                Susan Rankin was born in Saskatchewan in 1959. She is known all over North America and possiblly bits and pieces of other countries, but how did she get there? I am going to tell you a bit from her past. In 1984 she went to Pilchuck Glass School in Stanville, Washington. She had one teacher she really liked and that was Klause Moje. Eventually she moved on to Penland School of North Carolina where she was learning how to improve her art. She didn't need to though she had already won so many awards. for example in 2006 she won the Ontario Arts Council, Individual Craft Grant.
