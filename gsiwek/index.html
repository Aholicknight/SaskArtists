				Gerri Ann Siwek was born Hamilton and attended art college in Toronto. She moved to Regina in 1981 working as an educator and designer.<br/><br/>

				Her earlier work as a post modernist explored subjects from the paranormal to the museum. All were handled with grace and humour. She created a travelling installation called Funomena Museum of the Weird and Strange.<br/><br/>

				Gerri Ann's work has evolved into studies of nature in water colour and encaustic. </p>
