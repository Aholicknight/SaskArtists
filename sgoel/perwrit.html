  <p align="left"><font size="4">The scientific method has evolved with a specific 
    quality of viewing its subject. In this way it creates a unique world perspective 
    which, due to the gravity of science, has influenced society’s methods of 
    viewing - creating a lense which has specific focal point. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">We explore the scientific method of developing 
    perspective; its way of “looking through”.looking through”. This method has several key characteristics; 
    it is a tool of examination which goes from wide to narrow (macro to micro) 
    by successively removing layers; it has a linear structure; and it functions 
    as a repeatable process. The use of this perspective as a fundamental tool 
    of establishing societal logic influences our ability to see, to focus, and 
    to reason. This encompasses both tnd 
    to reason. This encompasses both the physical and the mental realm of human 
    existence. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">Physical sight is our primary method of understanding 
    our surroundings in respect to ourselves. Through sight we learn the rules 
    of vision: distance; depth; height; inferred relationships (i.e. large = heavy) 
    etc. This quality leads us towards an added meaning beyond a simple physical 
    relationship into one of mental association (i.e. large = important). This 
    form of “mental sight” is formed as physical perception passes througn passes through the 
    filter of societal perceptions (life experience, culture, gender, class, and 
    age) which is mediated by scientific method. This filter trains our experience 
    towards a method of valuing events. Scientific method is a lense through which 
    experience passes focusing attention by honing in on its subject, but also 
    by excluding information labeled as extraneous. </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="4">The viewer enters a white room which narrows 
    in width (figure 1). A series of 8 microscopes is set up on pedestals along 
    the length of the room. Each microscope views one slide. The lense of the 
    microscope will serve as a lense of perspective. Each slide will draw the 
    viewer closer to a final focal point. </font></p>
  <o a final focal point. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">The slides:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"> 1. the landscape (prthe landscape (prairie) </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">2. a house in the distance on the landscape </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">3. the house close - the landscape out of visual 
    range </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">4. the window of the house - the house out of 
    visual range </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">5. the view into the house through the window 
    - the frame out of range </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">6. the table in the house </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">7. the fruit on the table </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">8. a seed in the fruit </font></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">As the images tighten visually, the room correspondingly 
    narrows providing a physical parallel. The slides can be viewed from either 
    direction, (wide to narrow or narrow to wide) providing the potential for 
    a double vision in which the seed constructs the landscape as much as the as much as the 
    landscape constructs the seed. </font></p>
