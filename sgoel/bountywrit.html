  <p align="left"><font size="4">This is a work about pedophilia in ethnically 
    isolated communities and how those communities choose to protect themselves/the 
    abuser/the children. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">The piece was exhibited in a small gallery space 
    (approx. 12' X 12') </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">In the centre of the room was a low, square, 
    white pedestal (2.5' X 2.5') on which there was a pile of 1000 child sized 
    ears made of kool-aid scented/coloured play ded/coloured play dough.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"> In one corner of the room there was pedestal 
    (3' tall, 1' X 1' square on top) which acted as an audio station. Extending 
    out from a hole in the pedestal was a head set which played a digitally manipulated 
    cycle of a lullaby sung in Hindi overlayed by the sound of an infant crying. 
    Beside the headset was a 5 line statement :</font></p>he headset was a 5 line statement :</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="4">The choice of the subject matter was the result 
    of personal experience; the choice of imagery came from the images of bounty 
    hunting in the Vietnam war - each side hunting the othernting the other, and the practise 
    of collecting the ears of the hunted as proof of their deaths. In many ways 
    I equate the bounty hunter with the pedophile; both are hunting, but the paedophile 
    doesn’t take life but rather childhood.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font size="4"> facets of the work:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">The language expresses double meanings: bounty 
    as plenty; children as the bounty of society; bounty as the prize or catch. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">The brightly coloured ears are both alluring 
    and revolting. It is difficult to understand how one is supposed to react 
    to them. They are ears, but can’t hear - in North American culture ears are 
    also a symbol of speaking to some extent - it is the two sided street - without 
    being able to heed street - without 
    being able to hear are we able to speak? Are these the ears of the silenced 
    community not speaking against internal against internal crimes, or of the children who can 
    not be heard? Finally the headset amplifies the quality of isolation by forcing 
    the viewer to place something over their own ears - thereby blocking out the 
    room to some degree. As well, the sounds are confusing and threatening; the 
    song is in another language, and it is difficult to tell if is supposed to 
    sooth the child or terrify it. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4">The viewer is left with the feeling that the 
    castrated ears are the only ones who could understand the sounds from the 
    headset - but they are deaf and incapable.</font></p>
