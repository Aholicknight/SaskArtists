Seema Goel is an artist, biologist and writer originally from Regina, Sk.  Her work critically investigates the intersticial spaces created when seemingly opposed or separate  things meet  i.e. art and science, cultural expectation and individual desire. Though primarily an intermedia installation artist, she alsot, she also works with (and incorporates) glass, clay, acrylic, oil, video, projection and film. Her current work explores the nostalgia-lust phenomena  and the method by which memories are constructed, both for ones self, and for a physical place.  Seema is about to embark on her MFA in sculpture at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, RI.</font></blockquote></blockquote>
