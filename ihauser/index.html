Her earliest memories are of waking up in the middle of the night, her head full of visions. She then would try to draw what she saw in her head with crayons. (maybe as early as 4 years old) ...

                    It is the "emotional content" that Hauser wants to bring forward, she says. She has always been interested in intense emotional work, describing it as marrying an idea to a story feeling.

                    Iris is noted for her "structured narrative" paintings which incorporate symbolic and iconic imagery addressing the human condition;" "She paints large colourful portraits exploring personal and often disturbing subjects."
