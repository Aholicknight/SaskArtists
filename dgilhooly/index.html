<p>David Gilhooly is a sculptor, who is known for his ceramic sculptures, most of which are of animals, food, plants, and Frogs. Or what he calls: "FrogWorld"</p>
<p>David was born in Auburn California in 1943, he graduated the University of California in 1967.</p>
<p>Later, he and 4 other artists started working together in what would be called "The Funk Ceramic Movement" in San Francisco</p>
<p>David moved to Regina in 1969, teaching until 1971 at the University of Saskachewan.</p>
<p>While still in Regina, he also was a spirtual instigator of "back to the land" alternitive media, with good humour, while David was in Regina, we worked with many artists such as <a class="white" href="../mpeeples.1">Maya Peebles Bright.</a></p>
