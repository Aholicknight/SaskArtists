			Augustus Kenderdine was a Lancashire born artist who lived from 1870-1947. He is famous for his work with landscapes and portraits. Kenderdine studied art under his grandfather, Chevalier De la Fosse, at the Manchester School of Art. He was also apprenticed ro several local artists before establishing his own business, "Gus Kenderdine: Photographer and Art Dealer". He later married, and fathered four children with Jane Ormerod at Garstang, where he had been painting.<br /> <br /> <br />
			Kenderdine moved to Saskatchewan in 1908, inspired by the stories of the Barr Colonists and their utopian settlement of Brittania. For a decade he was preoccupied by the labours of farming and ranching, before turning his farming operations over to his son. <br /><br /><br />
			Kenderdine painted several portrait commisions and later exhibited his work across Canada, although he is best known in Saskatchewan. He did several lanscape studies in charcoal in a style simmilar to Gainsborough(The feathery brushwork of his mature work and rich sense of colour contribute to the enduring popularity of Gainsborough's portraits). As a result of his training in England and France, he painted many romantic depictions of the Saskatchewan landscape. His imagery recast Saskatchewan's topography in the comforting image of Europe.<br /><br /><br />
			Kenderdine taught at the University of Saskatchewan. Oddly enough, his painting studio, which he also taught out of was in the Physics building of the U of S . He also established the Murray Point Art School at Emma Lake, and taught summer art camps.
