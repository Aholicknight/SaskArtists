    <h1>What Is This Man</h1>
    <h3>By Maxine Athene</h3><br>
    <p>What is this man who keeps his breath,</p>
    <p>In keeping with the tales that bind him so?</p>
    <p>He is a master,</p>
    <p>He is a martyr,</p>
    <p>Choice a maker,</p>
    <p>Last a taker,</p>
    <p>He finds himself in spider's snare to save himself,</p>
    <p>Whoa be thine!</p>
    <p>I will bring you wine,</p>
    <p>I will bring you heather,</p>
    <p>I will find the solitaire and give it as a gift for your
    blessing,</p>
    <p>Please the sail that carries you,</p>
    <p>Appease the wail that covers you,</p>
    <p>Be a breaker for the craft that marks your way,</p>
    <p>And all the angels will call you destine.</p>
