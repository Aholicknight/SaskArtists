<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/hebrewa.jpg" SIZE=100 ALIGN=CENTER></IMG><STRONG>  Dialogues for Dan</STRONG>
<P>Pseudo Hebrew poetry on the belly of Bilhah.  In the video, the script represents a pledge of Jacob
to honour the baby within Bilhah's womb in a manner equivalent to the children of Leah.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/pete1.jpg" width=325 length = 400 SIZE=100 ALIGN=CENTER></IMG><STRONG>  Pete Makarow:  Untitled</STRONG>
<P>What would Salvador Dali think, when the hands and insects of this sculpture didn't invoke a
violent backlash?  Dispite prominant display this work has not received bureaucratic nor public vandalism.
<HR>
<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/pete02.jpg" width=325 length = 400 SIZE=100 ALIGN=CENTER></IMG><STRONG>  Pete Makarow:  His All Seeing Eye Beholds</STRONG>
<P>This is one of Makarow's mot controversial works.  Within a month of Peter's death the City of Regina
was demanding its removal and destruction or legal action and punitive measures would be taken.
This sculpture was disassembled and probably destroyed.

<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/pete03.jpg" width=325 length = 400 SIZE=100 ALIGN=CENTER></IMG><STRONG>  Pete Makarow:  Alter Peace</STRONG>
<P>The play on words is an example of how Makarow plays on symbolism.  Four erect snakes surround a painted vat.  The insect
covered vessel was a piece that Peter dedicated to harmony.  Vandal attacks have not destroyed the curiosity in five years.

<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/bunny01.jpg" width=400 length = 400 SIZE=100 ALIGN=CENTER></IMG><STRONG> Bunny Slippers</STRONG>
<P> Bunny Slippers is a video about eternity.  Three abstract elements are provided to a painter
(Amber Fife) and choreographer (Krista Solheim).  The elements were a surf song, bunny slippers and six legs.  The different
receipes for combining these elements results in a visual smorgasborg.  Perhaps anecdotal incite is gained into the phenomenon of
creativity by this video.
