Bloor's Quilt (Smaller)</STRONG>
<p>Bloor's quilt is part of a minature series honouring the Regina Five.
The series is called <a href="quilts.htm">If the Regina Five had been women would they 
have made quilts?</A> which used pipe cleaners and acrylic paint to respond to the 
innovations of forty years ago.</p>

Masonic Abstracts</STRONG>
<p>Fred Tunison Sr. thought that the past masters of Wascana Lodge #2 AF & AM
should all have a Wayne Tunison painting.  Tunison uses abstract symbolism
to convey masonic principles.

<p>The <A HREF = "wword.htm">written word</A> is often used as texture in Tunison's works.  This work is 
made up of phrases coined by friends Bonnie-Lynn Holter and Glen Urquhart along
with Tunison.  An appropriated tourist image is modified as a relevant foundation
while the text spills onto the matting.  The written word often serves as a way to 
express pain, frustration or even elation by ranting with possible obscurity.
