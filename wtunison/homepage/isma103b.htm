<STRONG>  Democracy Works (from <A HREF="isma103c.htm">Social Spaces</A>)</STRONG><P>The concept of democracy has always intrigued me, therefore I created some polling stations with ballots:<UL><LI>Choose an animal for extinction<LI>Choose a magazine to be banned<LI>Choose someone to die<LI>Choose a building to be destroyed</UL><P>These democratic questions were intended to provoke thought about the environment, censorship, capitol punishment, and urban planning.  I found it interesting that a minority of the 200-300 voters chose a provocative entertainer rather than a notorious murderer for execution.  The only building that received no vote for destruction was Central Collegiate.  Remarkably, City Council granted a demolition permit to that site and Central Collegiate was destro was destroyed in the summer of 1994. <BR> F.Wayne Tunison</P>
