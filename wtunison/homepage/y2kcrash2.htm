      <p>"Computers didn't crash in Regina as 1999 gave way to 2000, but at Knox-Metropolitan 
        United they fell - literally, from seven stories up.</p>
      <p>"In a performance-art piece conceived by Knox Metropolitan bell-ringer 
        Wayne Tunison, six out-of-date (read:Y2K Non-compliant) computers were 
        tossed from the church roof as bells at the church and elsewhere in Regina 
        rang a mix of mourning and celebration.</p>
      <p>"Tunison, a computer engineer by day, says the idea was to symbolize 
        the 'death and birth' that occured simultaneously as the century rolled 
        over. Tossing computers ntury rolled 
        over. Tossing computers off the church roof was a way of showing 'symbols 
        of disaster leaving our lives'.</p>

<p>"Traffic ground to a halt in a five-block area around Knox-Metropolitan during 
  the noon hour on New Year's Day as apprentice bell ringer Trevor Corridon hurled 
  the computers.</p>
<p>"Just as Y2K fears crumbled with the arrival of the new century, 'there wasn't 
  much left' of the old clunkers after the performance ended, says Tunison."</p>
