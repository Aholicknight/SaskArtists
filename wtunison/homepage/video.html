            Collaboration: Is creating with others. It is the surrender of some aspect of control to someone who will change the outcome of the project. The following describes the mode of collaboration.

            Denise, Michele and Wayne workshopped their characters of Bilhah, Rachael and Jacob over the space of several months. Several sources were used including Hebrew mythology and the Christian Bible. The narrative was simple, Rachel convinces Bilhah to have a child for her with Jacob. Visually the video is a study of Denise's body during her pregnancy while the audio is a taste of the frustration of the early eavesdropper.

            This was a summer camp project used to test the abilities of the young teens with video equipment, found footage challenges and collabouration. The success of this project was the justification for the computer opera project 'Projekt Klingsor'.

            These videos are intended as stand alone works which are shown in an art gallery. Two or more can be displayed at once with the acoustical spaces overlapping. A set of software engineering requirements were developed to permit different teams to construct the sound tracks:

            For several months the downtown bars, clubs and drop in centres were combed seeking stories of misery and hate. After these stories were captured on tape or in notebooks, Amber Fife began the process of telling those stories as her own. The gore, the blood and malice were mitigated and Amber chose to transform half of her body into black. Found stories - partnered transformation- solo performance / artsy video = collaboration.

            Darlene Tincher designed and manufactured striking masks and wanted them uniquely displayed. Wayne Tunison designed and directed a psuedo-ritual with the sole intention of presenting the masks. An anonomous dancer was added as priestess to perform her interpretation of the masks' spirit. Sounds were found in Bali, Pow Wows and inner city Regina to give a primitive Hip Hop ambience.

            As the academic researches of Wayne advanced so did his version of multimedia software engineering. Like the Hours of Flowers series this video is visually one hundred percent Tunison while the sound track was engineered by a team of: Miriam Arendt, John Redant, April Lloyd, Jerry Swetlow and Darren Bachelu. Tunison provided the software engineering requirements.
