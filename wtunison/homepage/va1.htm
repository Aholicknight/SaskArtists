<ul><H4>    Albert Street </H4></ul>
<P>Started in 1988 this 'Street Piece' parallels the journey down Albert St. (across Regina) to that of life.  
As Tunison's life is travelled so is Albert St. with juxtaposed sound and side journeys.
<UL><H4>    Art of Albert Gatin</H4></UL>
<P>Albert Gatin is a pioneer of figurative art in a land dominated by landscape and abstract
art.  Albert has influenced many professional and amateur artists throughout the province as
teacher, mentor, colleague and friend.  This documentary samples some serialistic 
landscapes, portraits and of course figures, by this industrious enigmatic character.
<UL><H4>    Awakening</h4></UL>
<P>  Techniques of negative video are explored with this body piece.  Is this stone or flesh that 
rises in the morning?  What does the mirror show?</P>
<UL><H4>    CD69 CDF  </h4></UL>
<IMG SRC="../pictures/cd69.jpg" SIZE=70 ALIGN=LEFT>
A homage to the great avante guarde film makers of the world is presented with autobiographical narritive.  The symbol of the shared pipe is used to include many patrons of Tunison's art.  Renoir, Snow, Bragage, Dali, Vertov, Rimmer, Ritcher, Elder, Melies, Anger, Kerr, Bunuel, and ..... are referenced in copy cat to sardonic imitation.  This is not a travelog but shows many sites of Regina.<p></P>

  Christmas Video 1998 Including: Roger Ing's Utopia and Alfred Jarry's Ubu The King
   </h4></UL>
<p>A tradional Christmas letter in video, chronicaling the events of 1998. It 
contains the play 'Ubu The King', and footage from Roger Ing's presentation, Utopia.</p>
<A NAME="dialogues">
<UL><h4><a HREF="video.html#dialogues">Dialogues for Dan</a> (33 min)</h4></ul>
<IMG SRC="../pictures/dan.jpg" SIZE=80 ALIGN=LEFT> 
<p>Rachel the beloved wife of Jacob had trouble getting pregnant.  She convinced her half sister and handmaiden Bilhah to act as a surrogate mother for her.  This is the story of Rachel's dialogues for 
obtaining her objectives.  Michele Sereda (Rachel) improvizes 'pinter-like' arguments to gain compliance from Denise Gelech (Bilhah) through peer subjugation.  This body piece experiments with the concept of the 'GAZE of intensity' and 
with the 'message of the EAVSEDROPPER'.  Not intended for Sunday School but intended for a 
guide to spiritual reflection on intimite relations.<p></P>

<UL><H4>   Facing Three Eves    </H4></UL>
<p> The crone, the whore and the maid describe reality. </p>
<UL><H4>   Fall of 87     </H4></UL> 
<P>    This is a visual and audio document of a handfull of the activities held at Neutral Ground Art 
Gallery in the autumm of 1987.</P>
<UL><H4>    Family Friends and Fun    (12 min)</H4></UL>
<P>      This is a collaborate effort among Chadwick, Galloway and Tunison to portray the wholesome 
fun that nudists enjoy at their events.  </P>
<a name="hours">
<UL><H4>    <a HREF="video.html#hours">Flora in A</a> (104 min)</H4></UL>
<P>This abstract video explores the flower in the manner of a body piece.
It is intended to stand on its own in an art gallery.  This accoustic space
of the video presentation should be open for cohabitation with one of its sister vides (example Flora in C).
This video should blend in with the other floral art of Tunison.</P>
<UL><H4>    <a HREF="video.html#hours">Flora in C</a> (104 min)</H4></UL>
<P>Like its sister videos (Example Flora in A) is intended for presence
or decoration rather than virtual viewing.  The Flora videos had different teams construct
their sound tracks.
<UL><H4>    <a HREF="video.html#hours">Flora in G</a> (104 min)</H4></UL>
<P>The family of video based on flowers have served two purposes.  The first
is to explore the flower visually while secondly it has presented challenges
to software engineering teams to create sound tracks that are distinctive
yet compatible with the other videos.
<ul><H4>    Foolin Around   </H4></ul>
<IMG SRC="../pictures/foolin.jpg" SIZE=107 ALIGN=LEFT><p>   When the technology crowd get together how do they have fun?   The workers of Westbridge Computer Corporation are seen in feast and folly.</P>

<ul><H4>    Godiva Rides   </H4></UL>
<IMG SRC="../pictures/godiva.jpg" SIZE=80 ALIGN=LEFT>
<p>The Lady Godiva ride is a long standing tradition of the university engineering student.  The psychology of the people involved in such events is explored through the telling of urban legend and personnal reflection.  Godiva ride footage and stills are intercut with the disclosures to form a unified tale of frivolity and discovery.</P>

<A NAME="fault">
<UL><H4>      <a HREF="video.html#fault">It's Not My Fault</a> (18 mins)  </H4></UL>
<P>      Amber Fife becomes half black while she reflectively performs
her version of three naratives that Tunison harvested from the downtown bars.
Illusions and texts of rape, gang violences, castration and baseball teams 
extremes are explored. </P>
<UL><H4>      Happy 25th Anniversary  </H4></UL>
<P>      Over the coarse of a 25 year relationship much is changed and much is accumulated.  This document shows the collection of friends, the social positioning, the children and the way it was.  The wealth is symbolized by the feast,  the happiness by the dancing and the bonds by the expressions cast by all. </P>
<a name="toast">
<UL><H4>       <a HREF="video.html#toast">Hot Coloured Toast</a>   (15 min)</H4></UL>
<P>       This a collaborative work using found footage (some from broadcast TV) and twenty two teenagers.  The teenagers used the video toaster to alter their found footage to integrate in a group work called 'Hot Coloured Toast'.  The techniques in video/sound management and integration used in this project form the basis for the action research 'PROJEKT KLINGSOR'.  The overall statement of this work was 'abstract(toast), 1993(hot), personnal view(coloured)'.  </P>
<UL><H4>       Love Her With Feeling </H4></UL>
<P>        The legendary guitar wonder girl Sue Foley sings and plays as the mannequins of the world strut their stuff for an emotive response.  Sue belts out the blues, bends the stings and moves her audience to Love that Girl with Feeling.  Underground rock and roll from the dingy midwestern bars was never finer.</P>
<UL><H4>        Making a Valentine for You   </H4></UL>
<P>          The carving of a valentine with a straight razor to the chant of a child gives an errie image to contemplate the expression of love.  Pain, danger, and even death have accompanied this egmatic emotion of human.  Reflection-YES Arousal-NO......</P>
<a name="masks">
<UL><H4>       <a HREF="video.html#masks">Masks</a></H4></UL>
<P>
<a name="toronto">
<UL><H4>       <a HREF="video.html#toronto">Toronto Version 1A</a> (28mins)</H4></UL>
<P>A travel document intended to show the harsh, unobserved and perhaps some of the underbelly of the Canadian city of 'GOOD'.
This is the first of the travelogue series which are intended to be shown with maps (chartography) appropriated for personalization, 
integration or alteration.  This was shown first at the Social Spaces show.
<UL><H4>        The Plains  </H4></UL>
<P>        The Plains Motor Inn is a hotel/blues palace which with its weather
tower has become a landmark of the Canadian prairie.  This short drama of talking heads explores
the art and craftyness of storytelling.  Allegations and beliefs
are openly exposed for the viewers disection and comparison.  Dark ambience, sorrowful harp and deceptively believable performances
make this a classic of jurisprudence.</P>
<UL><H4>        Prayer #3   </H4></UL>
<P>        The prayer videos are experiments in juxtaposition of elements that could be sent to the Almighty in prayer.  Prayer #3 is a prayer of confession and forgiveness juxtaposing the rising billows of colour with the pained music of prepared piano, muted trombone, whistle and drum.  </P>
<UL><H4>        Prayer #5   </H4></UL>
<P> A naked red hair woman prays in the autumm bush. The camera zooms out. Blake 
  is recited against the scratchy sound of 'If within your heart you truly seek 
  me'. God, man, nature, prayer ... a complete seamless integration.</P>
<A NAME="washington">
<UL><H4>      <a HREF="video.html#washington">Washington Version 1</a> (95 mins)  </H4></UL>
<P>The first of the alternative travelogues documenting the various excursions
of Tunison.  Visually a rythmic set of jump cuts and dissolves display a side of the geography
rarely captured by the travel enthusiast.  The sound track was software engineered
by computer enthusiasts under a set of requirements proposed by Tunison.  See Washington D.C. 
(Da Capital) as never before.</P>
