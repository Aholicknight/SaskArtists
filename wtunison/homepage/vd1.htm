<UL><H4>  Cannibalism  <I>by Ian Smith (62 mins)</I> </H4></UL>
<P>   Ian Smith presents the distasteful subject of cannibalism in a delightful series of comedies.  Thoughts are wrenched out of the audience as he challenges them to empathize with the cannibals.  In the end the average Christian is checking his values against the sacrament of communion while Smith's outrageous performance is spinning with ritual and fact.  </P>

<H4>  Carpé What <I>by Darren Sibelus (23 min)</I> </H4></UL>
<P>   A circus in the junkyard complete with Lobster Girl, fireworks, accordian rock n' roll, fanfares and effigy burnings takes place at dusk.  There was standing room only.</P>
<UL><H4>  Darke Isle <I>by Glenda Stirling performed by The Curtain Razors</I> </H4></UL>
<P>   <I>Dark Isle</I> is a one act play, set on the East Coast of Scotland, which follows the
life of a young woman and her family just prior to her decision to leave her home and emigrate to
Canada.  When a woman grows out of her environment, hearts are broken and lives are deformed.  This sensitive, 
coming of age story juxtaposes the aspirations of the young against the misery of a shattered relationship.
The play combines language, movement, and music to create a world more primal and poetic
than realistic, in which the four characters each deal with loss and courage. Distance - physical, emotional,
and sexual - is the driving force behind the play.  <i>Dark Isle</I> is an examination of home:  what it is
and how we choose to leave or remain there.  Blame it on the land. 1999</P>
<UL><H4>  Fat Girls (Wear All Sizes) <I>by Kelly Jo Burke performed by The Curtain Razors</I></H4></UL>
<P><i>Fat Girls</i> is an analysis of the fear of fatness, the tyranny of self-image, and the viciousness
of sibling rivalry with a macabre, irreverent funny style.  Mom is dying of cancer and ecstatic about it:  she's
a size seven at last and finally has collarbones.  Bettina eats non-stop and is exceptionally free with her
black garbed and plumpish body until slim and perfect sister Lisa arrives home to shape everyone up.  And then
there's the insidious, brutal presence of the Mirror out to tyrannize everyone according to her own fears and weaknesses.  1991</P>
<UL><H4>  Fat Men In Skirts <I>by Nicky Silver performed by The Curtain Razors</I> </H4></UL>
<P>After their plan crashes, Phyllis and her son Bishop are stranded on a desert island for 5 years.
Meanwhile Howard, Phyllis' husband and famous movie director, continues his life with his somewhat loopy mistress Pam.
Using the "minefield" of the family as his context Nicky Silver, one of contemporary theatre's leading playwrights
from New York, explores human nature in relationship.  He strips societal rules, conditioning and roles to reveal our
still primal and often barbaric nature in shocking light.  <i>Fat Men</i> is an absurd comedy revealing our hope for healing 
our relationships within each other and ourselves.  1997.</P>
<UL><H4> A Fertile Imagination <I>by Susan Cole performed by The Curtain Razors</I> </H4></UL>
<P><i>A Fertile Imagination</i> is a comic-serious play that provides "a keyhole view of reality", and
which inspires its audience to feel.   A Western Canadian premiere, it is about two women who want to have
a baby together using artificial insemination.  The production was intrigued with the subject of what
makes a family, who has the right to a family, and the exploration of the changing family structure.  1993.</P>
<UL><H4>  Frozen <I>by Michele Sereda</I> </H4></UL>
<P>   <i>Frozen</i> is a solo written and conceived by Michele Sereda, that is a discussion of a 
lady living in a roadside ditch negotiating her next destination.  It follows the journey of a 
frozen woman who tries to maintain her connection to her core, and a patch of land, while
the environment interferes with her permanency.  <i> Frozen</i> is an examination of land, roots, identitiy, 
and community and poses the question of who owns land.  A poetic world of isolation, barrenness, and stillness
is revealed through the use of text, movement, and sound.  Neil Cadger (theatre/dance artist) says, "<i>Frozen Lady</I> was a 
refreshing taste of the art of the theatre.  I found myself in a complicity with Michele as she recounted the fragmented and hallucinatory
thoughts of a woman freezing to death; ideas flickering like the last sparks of the last synapses in a woman's life.  Cold but sterile."

<UL><H4>  Frozen Heart <I>by Lalle Douglas (10 mins)</I> </H4></UL>
<P>   The techniques of time lapse photography are used to show the melting of a frozen 
heart.  Time is compressed at a ratio of about 40:1.</P>
<UL><IMG SRC="../pictures/robert.jpg" SIZE=100 ALIGN=CENTER><H4>  Glow in the Dark <I>by Robert (29 min)</I> </H4></UL>
<P>   What are our actual dimensional coordinates in the cosmology?  Vancouver Island must be relevant.
Consider the technological improvements that are cast upon the human race.  Storage vessels
for energy must be as relevant as information silos.  Do the clothes make the man?</P>
<UL><H4>  Hearts, Roses and Other Stories <I>by Lalle Douglas (10 min)</I> </H4></UL>
<P>   A fascinating installation at Neutral Ground about the human heart and the concepts of it frozen or melting.</P>
<UL><H4>  The House of Mutant Women <I> by Chris Scott performed by The Curtain Razors</I> </H4></UL>
<P>What if aliens landed in Saskatchewan at the farm down the road.  How would your mother take it?
What about your sister?  By the way, are there any aliens down the road?</P>
<UL><H4>  It's a Small World <I>by Connaught Public School, Regina (99 min)</I> </H4></UL>
<P>   The March 14, 1990 performance of this classic of World Peace shows us and the inner
city crowd that despite our differences people are basicly the same.  Directed by Miss Thompson and Mrs. Edwards.</P>
<UL><H4>  The Look <I> by The Curtain Razors</I></H4></UL>
<P><i>The Look</i> was a project commissioned by the Regina International Children's Festival
and then moved into a southern Saskatchewan school tour.  <i>The Look</I> is a teen show probing
the realities behind the myths of beauty, image, and the fashion industry and how these myths
affect our society and youth.</P>
<P>   The shaping of female flesh, the economic exploitation of her smell, the brainwashing of her mind with fashion propaganda are all explored in this bizarre dramatic essay.  Costain's pained ballet of the fashion model is hilarious,  Sereda's tear jerking recounts of liposuction made everyone squirm and flinch their bottom.  Feminist analysis of the modern women's weakness makes thought provoking teen comedy. 1994.</P>

<H4>Lover's Progress <I>by Michele Sereda</I> </H4></UL>
<P>Curtain Razors, in collaboration with the MacKenzie Art Gallery, are
pleased to present a new performance inspired by poet David Solway's
book length poem, The Lover's Progress, to take place November 21, 22
and 23, 2002. 
<P>
Drawing from William Hogarth's 18th century engravings of A Rake's
Progress series and Solway's collection of poems, that are similar in
fashion to Hogarth's eight plates,  Michele Sereda, artistic director of
Curtain Razors, has created a performance which captures the critical
moments in the lover's career. Staged in the MacKenzie Art Gallery
Salon, we meet the female counterpoint to Solway's lover caught in a web
of confusion, trying to move forward from the last island of desire.
With text, song, movement and through another voice;
Sereda's lover tells her story. The performance is created and staged by
Michele Sereda featuring the voice of Gary Farmer, and sound design by
Don Stein.</P>
<UL><H4>  MadWoman <I>by The Curtain Razors</I></H4></UL>
<P>Through various images prevalent throughout the ages, ranging from the wart-ridden witch in Hansel and Gretel to 
Medusa with her hair of live snakes, the image of the MadWoman was juxtaposed into various guises and forms of madness.
This 1996 work investigated the need within people and society to acknowledge and free the creative energy of the MadWoman.</P>
<UL><H4>  A Protestant Thought:  Memory  <I>an installation by Franklyn Heisler (6 min)</I> </H4></UL>
<P> This September 1990 installation has accented for the documentor many of the Artificial Intelligence issues.
The filter and encode/decode errors and storage inaccuracies are demonstrated by powerful human examples
drawn from a distant maritime past. </P>
<UL><H4>  Really Rosie   <I>by Connaught Public School, Regina (28 mins) </I></H4></UL>
<P>   Five year old actors attempt musical feats as the senior students direct their juniors in a short musical of Chicken Soup.  Directed by Miss Ortmann.</P>
<UL><H4>  Trevor Tosses Them Off <I>by the Regina Bell Ringers</I></H4></UL>
<P>A thousand years ago, the world was coming to an end.  The disasters never really
materialized.  So history could repeat itself, doom and gloom was predicted for January 1, 2000.
The computers were to crash because the year 1999 represented by 99 would be less than 2000 represented by 00.
Like the medieval experience it didn't happen, except for those computers which Trevor Corridon threw off the Knox Metropolitan
United Church bell tower.  Seven computers crashed as the bells sounded changes. 
<UL><H4>  True West <I>by Sam Shepard performed by The Curtain Razors</I></H4></UL>
<P>   <i>True West</i> is a very masculine work about a violent brother relationship, man's relationship to the land,
and the relationship of the son to the family.  (The piece has strong undertones of the prey/predator relationship.)
By cross-casting a violent brother relationship as two sisters the nature of this production became a vehicle to explore
society's views of women.  It toyed with creating a willful, aggressive, raw, passionate, and volatile female mythology.  1992.</P>
<UL><H4>  <A HREF="thea01.html">Ubu Roi</A>   <I>by Alfred Jarry performed by The Curtain Razors</I></H4></UL>
<P>Ma and Pa Ubu, wife and husband are planning to assassinate the King of Poland.  They 
scheme, argue, fight, manipulate, divide, kill and sometimes love in order to conquer
Poland for their own personal greed and strangely their gluttony.
The production of <I>Ubu Roi</I>, at Regina's MacKenzie Art Gallery was to take an international
classic and place it in a modern context to illuminate the world of impermanence and transience.  
<i>Ubu</I> was being updated from the late 19th century to the current world of thirty-second sound bits.
The "world" was attained by scrambling the order of the script and allowing visual image and movement
to propel action as opposed to psychological character motivation.  A collective of provincial artists
in non-specific racial roles and non-specific gender roles formed the company.  1998 </P>
<UL><H4>  Waiting for Godot <I>by Samuel Beckett  performed by The Curtain Razors</I> </H4></UL>
<P>   <i>Waiting For Godot</i> was an exploration into humankind's dilemma of the 
meaning of life.  This production discussed modern society's pressing concerns 
of the over-educated, the underworked, the so-called generation X, the need to reach into past decades
to inform and guide the present, and the world-wide uncertaintycaused by the crumbling of long-standing political,
economic, and social structures.  <i>Waiting For Godot</i> was presented in a warehouse space.  
When a performance makes you scratch you know that something has got under your skin.  The girls challenge the patience of the most devout. 1995.</P>

and coffee table bondage.</P>
