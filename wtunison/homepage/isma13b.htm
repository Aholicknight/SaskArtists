<strong> Annunciation (from <A HREF="../../../bells/fwtcon/fwtcon.htm">Mary's Mystery</A>)</strong>
<P> Rebecca McTaggert dressed as a 13th century Virgin Mary ponders her story
as recorded in Luke 1: 26-38.  At the appropriate time, Brian Vail steps from the 
bell choir representing the angel Gabriel.  Using helicopter swings on a large
bell Gabriel interrupts Tunison's arrangement of Eric Satie's Gymnopedia #3 for hand
bells and soprano (Rosemary Odie) with 'Hail Marys'. With these angellic 
words, seven toy seals with toilet paper (streamer-like) tails rain down on Mary.
This was a emblematic fertilization of a human.

<STRONG>  Democracy Works (from <A HREF="isma13c.htm">Social Spaces</A>)</STRONG>
<P>
The concept of democracy is always intriguing me, therefore some 
polling stations were created along with ballots:
<UL>
<LI>Choose an animal for extinction
<LI>Choose a magazine to be banned
<LI>Choose someone to die
<LI>Choose a building to be destroyed
</UL>
<P>
These democratic questions were intended to provoke thought 
about the enviroment, censorship, capital punishment, and urban planning.  
I found it interesting that a minority of the 200-300 voters chose a provocative 
entertainer rather than a notorious murderer for execution.  The only building that 
received no vote for destruction was Central Collegiate.  Remarkably, Regina City Council 
granted a demolition permit to that site and Central Collegiate was destroyed in the 
summer of 1994.

<strong> <a Href="isma13a.htm">Divorce</a></strong>
<P>When Tunison's wife left him he painted two large silver rings separating
on the family lawn.  Through the rings he painted a big black "X" symbolizing
the negative.  This earthwork grew out during the summer and was part of the
personal wailing and nashing of teeth that Wayne passed through.  It's hard to
say how impressed a neutral neighbour may have been.
<HR>
<strong> Fiesta Resistance</strong>
<P>On New Year's Eve 1996, Tunison performed as Father Time giving his own eulogy while coughing up blood
and removing the diaper from Baby 1997 and spanking her bottom.  When Father Time collapsed, Baby 1997,
modestly covering her nakedness, greets everyone in a fake Marilyn Monroe voice "Happy New Year".

<strong> Labours of Mary (from <A HREF="../../../bells/fwtcon/fwtcon.htm">Mary's Mystery</A>)</strong>
<P>Kate Herseberger dressed as a very traditional and very pregnant Mary arranges in the pose
of a barber chair.  Tunison dressed in Buffalo skin coat sporting a Rabbi-like beard and long hair
enters reciting the Ten Commandments.  At the end of each commandment the bell choir strikes a thick
chord moving towards a resolution by cadence at the end of the commandments.  Tunison arranges himself
comfortably on Mary and James Bates enters as Joseph who is not a carpenter in this case but a barber.
As Tunison continues to recite the commandments Joseph gives him a shave and trim as Mary screams with
labour pains due to ever accellerating contractions.  As the big push causes Mary to scream Joseph
helps Tunison out the Buffalo skin coat.  Tunison now dressed in a white suit with a white tie decorated 
with prairie lilies wanders through the sanctuary by walking barefooted on top of the pews.  The new 
commandment is to "Love Your Neighbour".

<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/orange01.jpg" SIZE=100 ALIGN=CENTER><strong>Orange Agent Test Area</strong>
<P>When a lot became vacant in Tunison's neighbourhood, he couldn't resist
using up all of his orange paint powders and small relics to decorate the lot.  
A sign was then placed in the middle of the property stating it was an <i>Orange
Agent Test Area</I>.  The project remained intact virtually untouched by vandalism
for the entire summer.  Nature was the one to obliterate this earth work.

<strong> Parthenogenesis (from <A HREF="../../../bells/fwtcon/fwtcon.htm">Mary's Mystery</A>)</strong>
<P>Although <i>Parthenogenesis</i> is not really a performance piece, its juxtaposition next to the performance piece
<i>Annunciation</i> has an element of the post-modern in it.  <i>Parthenogenesis</i> is a speaking duet where Rosemary Oddie
as a biologist describes in scientific terms the phenomena of parthenogenesis (prenancy without fertilization by the
male).  Brian Vail still as the angel Gabriel explores the concept 'with God nothing is impossible' Luke1:37.  The 
bell choir performed traditional English changes which had been modified by Tunison.  This contrapuntal sound piece
served as an alternative perspective of the pregnancy of the virgin Mary.

<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/soapbox2.jpg" width=300 height=150 ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../pictures/soapbox3.jpg" width=300 height=150 ALIGN=right>
<P>This was an interactive performance for the opening of the Social Spaces show.
Bus Chamberlin (son of Ernest Chamberlin the poet) mounts the traditional English soap box
to engage a crowd on the definition of relationships such as marriage, common-law and parenting.
He also challenges the crowd to account for the time of day that they have represented on their
personal time pieces.  Saskatchewan makes no effort for daylight savings time.  Bus would alternate
between the position of the sun and the state of relationships which such fluidity that the circular
arguments seem to have been choreographed by a skating coach.

<STRONG>Westbridge Birthday Egg</STRONG>
<P>This is a recursive scultural relic created to celebrate
the first birthday of Westbridge Computer Corporation.  The hollow
chocolate egg symbolizes Westbridge since the Westbridge corporate
logo was an orangish-gold circle with three black archs radiating
within it.  The hollow egg is an negative image of this by being
brown with three orange archs radiating within it.  Westbrigdge
was born by the privatization of the Crown Corporation SaskComp, thus
the egg is emerging from the SaskComp coffee mug.
