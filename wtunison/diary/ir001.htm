This paper defines several components found in the mall performance from a theatre
practitioners point of view in terms that are relative to our current explorations.  The mall
is a 'found' urban performance space.  It is ambiguous as to whether it is public or private
and is thus c or private
and is thus ideal for subversive use as a performance venue.  The street theatre opens all the
boundaries around class, age, gender, race etc., by using public space not designated
for theatre.  As the shopping mall becomes a global village phenomenon then in situ
performance using that space will join the Information Age.

Richard Schechner is referred to for his lifework in environmental theatre.  He quereferred to for his lifework in environmental theatre.  He questions the
relationship between the 'authorities' and the 'people' in locations such as the streets
or malls.  Umberto Eco makes a point, 'the larger the dominant system, the more distant
it appears, the easier it is to trick, to subvert and the less effectively it can control those
who move within it.'  (Eco, 1986).  From our architectural point of view, Peter Eisenman explored
the idea that real and imagined meaning is inscribed at a location.  Thus, semiotically
the site of a performance can be read as a text authored by a historically determally determined
by community practices.  The site specific performance are very open to ambiguous readings.
<P>
All cities provide public space and the mall is one of them.  Festivals sponsored by the dominant
force often limited opportunity of sanctioned disruption.  If a performance is outside of
the dominant agenda it is then subversion.

The shopping mall as the cathedral of consumption area considered to have no historical 
reverberation, no palimpsest or no texture.  They are a shrine of advertisement...  the need... the now...
look.  The security forces restrict entrance to those who are unable to buy.  To avoid 
expulsion for loitering, strategies of resistance are created such as window shopping, 
parading, hanging out and even shop lifting.
<P>
The paper ends with a series of thought provoking questions about the orthodox events
versus the queerville ththodox events
versus the queerville theatre.  Ownership and possession through occupation.

<H3>4) Comments:</H3>
I agree with mu/H3>
I agree with much of Irwin's analysis, but as an old infiltrator and practitioner of street/public
arts I see the mall as no more a challenge than the office tower or government office.
<P>
First, the malls are trying desperately to have a history of a human side to them.  This is by no
means to interfere with its primary objective of commerce.  Given that the power structure wants 
to have a human face, personal history, it is easy to find a middle ground to establish a
performance space.  To insult the venue or its owners will only lead to confrontation and
expulsion (maybe the intended final act) so subtle texts are most likely to have immediate
survival.
