Popular Discrimination (Fans and Productivity), John Fiske, <I>Understanding Popular Culture</I>, 1989.
<HR>
<H3>3) Summary:</H3>
Fans of an artist, sport or media event are the centre of Fiske's illustration of 
information consumers reading in a constructive way.  Fans engage with the text actively, personally, 
enthusiastically, politically, participatory and with unbridled passion.  Fiske presents some notions about 
bourgeois that there are bourgeois fans.
<P>ourgeois fans. <P>
Fans have very sharp intolerant preferences and have various methods of active engagement.  Some examples
are:
<UL>
<LI>soap opera gossip</LI>
<LI>Madonna imitation in video, dress and Karaoke</LI>
<LI>Star Trek has trekkies who write romances detailing events of episodes (Jenkins 1988).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Fiske introduces the concept of <A HREF="brico.htm">bricolage</A> which is a tribal practice of combining resources and 
material at hand to make objects, rituals and signs for their immediate needs.  This is a
typical practice of youth subcultures. (Hebdige(1979)).
Examples:
<UL>
<LI>Madonna look</LI>
<LI>punk combing of Nazis and British insignia</LI>
<LI>tape assemblage of songs from various albums</LI>
<LI>cooking and quilting</LI>
</UL>
<HR>
<H3>4) Comments:</H3>
I think that Fiske was holding back in this area of exploration.  I was expecting more on 
the semiotics, and chain reactions.
<P>
Some good ideas were presented.  I've engaged in bricolage as a fan and active producer/con and active producer/consumer
of information.  The concept of fan is an audit point to juxtapose against a possible 'sub culture'.
<P>
The ideas of power and active consumption bother me since they don't explain the model viewer
(the consumer who appears to comply and even thrive on the direct message).
