This work begins with reference to a lament by Octavio Paz in the Labyrinth of Solitutude describing
the minimal impression he received from the hispanic (particularly Mexican) influence on the city
of Los Angeles.  The dilemma of assimil  The dilemma of assimilation for immigrant minorities was presented
as: failure leads to exclusion in vital economic and political processes versus success leading
to annihilation of prized traditions.  Mass communication and cultural industries are 
described as leading to a contextless society.  Thus, the dominant social groups and cultural
minority face alienation in the confusion of  contemporary cultural.

Post-on in the confusion of  contemporary cultural.
<P>
Post-modern culture reveres ethnic minorities since they have developed strategies of ambiguity, appropriation,
juxtaposition and irony.  This gives them a bifocality.  It is on the level of the commodified
mass culture that acts of cultural bricolage happen.
<P>
The Los Angeles Chicano community preserves its past identity.  It even resources a complicated
cultural strategy of adapting to current needs.  Traditionally the Afro-Americans were
limited to the South Central region while the Mexican-Americans lived in East Los Angeles. 
After World War.  After World War II, small enterpreneurs catered to local markets with reasonable success until
the large corporations like RCA realized the commercial potential.
<P>
Don Tosti Band's 'Pachuco Boogie' is documented and analyzed to contain Mexican speech with 
Afro-American scat-singing and blues harmonies.  It sold in excess of two million.  This is the
germ of the movement that peaked with Los Lobos in the 1980s.  The core components of postmodern
sensibilites [Fischer, 1986] like bifocality, intertexuality, inter-referentiality, comparisons of
resemblance, juxaposition, reciprocity of perspectives, and multiple realities are shown to 
exist in the local music of Mexican-Americans of Los Angeles.  This fusion addresses the invisibility 
of the community.

On a recent trip to the area, I could not resist a bus ride through East Los Angeles to get
a ide through East Los Angeles to get
a feel for the situation.  Here are my observations:
<P>
I rode on three buses and the population od the population of the riders was at least 80% Hispanic.  The drivers
were black males or white females.  The signs were often redone in Spanish although there were signs
exclusive in Spanish.<BR>

Graffiti was Spanish-like.  Wall murals were a transformed Latin style with colours somewhat
subdued, more angularity and Hollywood-like references.  I tuned to a Spanish station as many were
