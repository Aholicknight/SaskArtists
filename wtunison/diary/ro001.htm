This is a survey of theories of resistance to cultural imperialism.  Questions are raised
about the term resistanut the term resistance.
<P>
Cultural Imperialism became a relevant topic in the 1960's with writers Armand Mattelart, 
Herbert Schiller and Dallas Smythe. Generally they approach their subject with 
structuralist communications analysis.  This was also a time of expansion for the
transnational corporation (TNC) particularly in South East Asia and the Southern Americas.
This work resulted in the New World Information and This work resulted in the New World Information and Communications Order (NWICO) which 
even evolved UNESCO.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
The work on cultural imperialism prepared an environment for some
interesting ideas:
<UL>
<LI>'the relay' a group or national identity that transmits global culture at a local level.  (Mattelart, 1979). </LI>
<LI>different ethnic origins lead to different readings of the same work (Katz and Liebes, 1984; 1986).</LI>
<LI>Warning:  methodology criticism can lead to conclusions of political motivation (even mercenary motives)
(Rogers and Schement, 1984). </LI>
<LI>PolysemyLI> <LI>Polysemy:  a postmodern idea of the absence of a 'meta narrative' in media texts (Lyotard, 1984). </LI>
<LI>Active Audience:  is a notion that audiences are free to construct their own meaning from media messages or texts
independent of the author or transmitting organization (Fiske, 1986, 1987; Grossberg 1984).</LI>
<LI>Sex-object or bitch portrayal of soap operas and MTV has a 'resistance reading' of empowerment to females (Brown 1984).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Active Audience and resistance theories point out that individuals or individuals as members of
a group construct their own meaning of media texts. This refutes the basis of culture imperialism
yet many of the theorists point out the existence of a dominant ideology.
<P>
The concept of the 'total cultural package' is nothing new and is a throwback to the pluralist concept of power.
(Schiller, 1993).  Also a veryt of power.
(Schiller, 1993).  Also a very interesting thought 'If there is a shadowy zone in critical
knowledge, it is definitely that of the py that of the procedures of consumption and reception of the media'
(Mattelart and Mattelart, 1992).  The recent work has also pointed out that 1) the individual, 
2) the subject, 3) the plurality of subjects, 4) pleasure and 5) public policy are all significant
factors.  The measurement of data (or even information traffic)  in flow analysis has validated
the existence of cultural or media imperialism (Boyd-Barnett and Thussu, 1992).  Creolization
of a culture is when a indigenous population creates their own media collateral in imitation
of the global-styles (Oliveria, 1993).  The term resistance has come under the scrutiny of the
politically correct movement.
<P>
Cultural imperialism and resistance in literary theory supports the notion of the previous
media critics from a much larger sample over a broader history.  The concept of empire
plays an important role in the evolution of globalism or universalism.  This is similar to the
dominant ideology previously mentioned  (Thiong'o, 1993; and Said, 1993).
<P>, 1993). <P> <HR>
<H3>4) Comments:</H3>
Cultural imperialism has always invoked an allergic reaction to me.  My response was
generally to switch it off.  Commercials, soaps, news and lifestyles sicken and bored me. I
think Fiske might think that my bourgeois sensibilities were dominating.  
(What would the bourgeois thnating.  
(What would the bourgeois think?)  I found a lack of engagement.
<P>
To satirically reconstruct or to analyze a media encounter was a sure way to neutralize 
some of the negativity.  I guess this was resistance.
<P>
I'm sure that there are flow analysis studies centered on Canada with data showing
Canada to be comparable to any cultural colony of the USA.  Unfortunately, the reaction
of most would be 'so what'.  This is why I think that it is more important to make a
Canadian show (message or text) than a successful global show.  The catch is that the
average Canadian would likely reject it out of habit.
<P> 
The concept of polysemy intrigues me.  Does consciousness play a part usness play a part of this?  The 
warning about methodology is well taken since I anticipate this approach.  Turning a negative
to a positive or even a positive to a negative is a post-modern principle I've taught
for years in my design seminars.
<P>
The active audience ideas still seem most relevant to me although the effects of dominant
ideology and public policy intrigue me.
<P>
Finally the 'total cultural package' work seems to support me hypothesis that multimedia
should empower the authors to engage and even exploit resistance.
