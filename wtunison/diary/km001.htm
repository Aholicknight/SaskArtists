This article describes the process of revolutionary attach of the system that has granted a degree
of freedom along with resources for living and attacking.  There are two ingredients to create this
process:  1) the seductive lullaby of perfectionism, utopian erfectionism, utopian dreams, elevating rhetoric and simple
abstract ideals 2) smug righteousness, absolute self-regard, condemnation of the status quo.  This always
leads to the confused fanaticism harbouring a despotic subtext beneath the progressive rhetoric.
The legacy of the American cultural revolution of the sixties is a disdain, or even self hatred
for 'the American way of life'.  In academy community, the greater th way of life'.  In academy community, the greater the exposure to higher
education, the more thorough the repudiation is likely to be.
<P>
The Vietnam war provided an event and/or text to exploit for delegitimation of many 
North American institutions.  Clerical activists, namely William Sloane Coffin, Jr. (Chaplain
at Yale) and the Berrigan brothers, Daniel and Philip (Catholic priests).  The background
of these individuals is outlined including family, military experience and of course
civil disobedience.
<P>
The fact that the opposition (justice instead of the law) came from representatives of tntatives of the religious
establishment sent a message of moral legitimacy.  The fact that they were repeatedly jailed
seems to have  not cast doubt on the message.  Philip was defrocked in 1973 for having
secretly married a man in 1969.  These men wrote of the virtue of the North Vietnamese compared
tot he injustice of Americans.  Heroic resistant against greedy oppression was the 
sanitized vision they presented.  Dazzled by these thoughts and delusions of their
own virtue they undermined not only the authority of established religion but the laws
they broke with such regularity and insouciance.
<P>
Now, we have a society where the thinkers react negatively to the compromises that have
and are sustaining the wealth and power of America.  A disrespect for the individual
freedoms which we won after centuries of patriarchal struggle.  The institutions which guard
ouruggle.  The institutions which guard
our culture, freedoms, and morality are left in a crisis of ideality, mission and legitimacy.

<H3>4) Comments:</H3>
This article struck a chord in me that I have sought for a long time.  I've sensed and
experienced the 'enlightened 'left'' to be far more totalitarian than society in general.  I
think of the 'politically correct' movement and the comedies of oppression performed in the name
of 'sexual harassment'.  It is a common complaint of my engineering colleagues of being down
graded because of their crude and direct response to social questions.  This is the 
fall out of the cultural revolution that put 'morality' before the law.
<P>
I think the legacy is an even further pollution (with low self esteem and irresponsibility) of the
legal system (if not just them why not a good business) of the traditional religious 
institutions (if not moral then why not a redundant social service) and the education system
(if not wise or knowledgeable then why not do industrial training).
