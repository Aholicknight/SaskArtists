This is one of the first CD-Roms that I appreciated for both style and content.
I was particularly taken by the probes section because they opened with fairly
strong examples of the concept.  The probe section (including Hot & Cool, The Medium
is the Message, Violm
is the Message, Violence and Identity, Figure/Ground, Extensions of Man, Tetrads, 
Acoustic & Visual Space, and The Global Village) also gave a good sense of the McLuhan 
thought processes which seem to be more artistic than academic.

He seems to ignore scientific proofs
and testing of hypothesis.  The classification of 'Hot and Cool' media is 
strongly The classification of 'Hot and Cool' media is 
strongly exemplified by the mix of animation, sound, and video demonstrating Adolf 
Hilter.  The Figure/Ground probe was also very useful to those working on the
e-government project.  The dynamic emphasis on the graphical foreground and the background
visually reinforced the McLuhan probe of Figure/Ground.  'There is no poverty
without affluence'.
<P>
Having the texts of book a like "<U>Understanding Media, the Extensions of Man</U>" in digital
form will undoubtedly be useful to the researcher.  For example, if a researcher wanted to know what McLuhannow what McLuhan
wrote on 'Africa', he would just search on the word and a pick list would be generated.  It was 
disappointing that a new media intro or summary was not prepared for these textual works.
<P>
The video section of the CD-Rom left me with a bad impression.  McLuhan presents his
thoughts in challenging and disjointed ways.  By having a series of video clips spanning
several years, strung together on a direct access index the discontinuities are 
magnified.  Thus the provocative is pushed to the ludricous.  A delivery mechanism
that contextualized in time, space or thought may have supported McLuhan rather than
'ridiculed'.
<P>
The section title 'On McLuhan' did much to give McLuhan the respect he deserves.  The people
commenting on McLuhan and his work included Derrick de Kerokhove (director of McLuhan Program in Cultural and Technology, University of Toronto), d Technology, University of Toronto), 
Robert Fulford, Liss Jefferey,  Bob Logan, Eric McLuhan, Camille Paglia (professor of Humanities at Cmanities at College of Performing Arts, Philidelphia), Louis Rossetto (Co-founder of Wired Magazine) and
Frank Zingrone (professor of Communication at York University).  This section contains much antidotal insite but was lazily crafted
with only 'talking head video' or 'video interview transcripts'.  I believe more than half
of the people interviewed would have gladly constructed something a little more imaginative for their
good friend Marshall.

<H3>4) Comments:</H3>
The CD-Rom is a good start in presenting the works of a thinker in multimedia form.  A good
tool for research is now available with examples of success and failure in a new media.
<P>
This was an important work for me since it was done in multimedia.  So much of my study is in
text or film, this gave me a chance to ponder the power of this media.
<P>
The sections that worked, like the Probes proved to communicate well to my colleagues in 
engineering.  The weak sections are hard to discuss because they are reasonable media 
translatmedia 
translations of better than adequate work in text or video.  To comment well, 
an alternative <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">such as?</FONT>should 
be presented.  At this time, I can only say that it feels incomplete.
