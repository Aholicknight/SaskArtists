Ethnography studies the culturally shared, common sense perceptions of everyday experience.  
Post-modern ethnography is a cooperatively evolved text relying on the reader to 
construct an aesthetic integration of the common sense reality.  It has an allegorical import without
a narrative.  Iwithout a narrative.  It favours discourse over text.  The separate tellings and stories can converge
on a common theme.  
<P>
Several ideas are presented such as: the newspaper as a preferred form, polyphony generates perspective relativity, 
the authorless text is a tradition (myth, folklore). Technology (tape recorders) provide a means to 'steal the
subjects voice'.
<P>
Post-modern ethnography is not an object but  voice'.
<P>
Post-modern ethnography is not an object but a means.  Its purpose is to invoke an understanding.
This provides freedom from representation and symbolism.  It is fragmentally like life and experience.

<H3>4) Comments:</H3>
The excitement I felt reading this was great.  It legitimizes many formal experiments I've carried
out over the years.  I also became inspired to create some work of a post-modern
ethnographic nature (that will have to wait for the right time).
<P>
Much of this paper was spent on descriptions of what post-modern ethnography was not:  generalizphy was not:  generalization,
descriptive (from a scientific view point), comparative, indicative or verifiable. I find this 
extreme in its attempt to place post-modern ethnography as a therapeutic process over the obvious
communication that takes place through the direct and constructed texts.
