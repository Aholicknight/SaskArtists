This paper opens up with a comparison of a weeping bourgeois feminist poet and
an unknown working class (chicken butcher) author of a letter to Hustler.
This sets the stage for the analysis of both Hustler conteof both Hustler content and the feminist
anti-porn critique of Hustler.
<P>
Hustler demonstrates all of the sins of male domination and exploitation including:
S/M, lesbians, fantasy realms.  The misogyny of Hustler is considered monumental.  The question of class also
appears relevant for both Hustler and its critics.  The market has Playboy
concentrating on breasts, Penthouse sensitively lingering on the soft
focus cs, Penthouse sensitively lingering on the soft
focus crotch shot and Hustler exploring the limits of both the female and the male
genitals.  Hustler knew no bounds of age, race, gender and even presented amputees
pre-operative transsexuals and pregnant women.  The Hustler body was unromanticized.  The
cartoon body of Hustler is embarrassingly unpleasant with vapours, liquids and solids
emitting into all area/venues of society.  Hustler is laced with political humour
and disrespect, adds against war, smoking and venereal disease.  Thus, Hustler serves as
mass circulation porn and mass circulation clascirculation class-antagonist.
<P>
Newsweek once commented, 'Hustler can be downright frightful... The net effect is to
transform the erotic into the emetic'.  Is Newsweek reacting to Hustler transgressing bourgeois
ideas of proper or is it the violating of the convention of men's magazines?  The power
of grossness is predicated on its opposition to high discourse.  Dominant ideology
works to enforce opposition producing class differences, somatic symbols and culture.  High
culture is structured through the obsessive banishment of the low, grotesque body.  The
classical body is a laminated service that is orifice free.  Hustler is active orifice centric.
<P>
The history of disgust runs parallel with the bourgeois need to remove the distasteful (dead animals, 
violence and sex) from the sight of society.  So a parallel of bourgeois disgust and 
anti-porn feminism is revealed.d 
anti-porn feminism is revealed.
<P>
Hustler's knack of finding and attacking the jugular of a culture's sensitivity could be
a straty could be a strategy of transgression to expose the unspeakable issues (breast cancer, AIDS, child abuse).
It is made clear through excrement, race and homosexuality, male readers have equal opportunity
to taste offensiveness.
<P>
A discussion of Freud’s analysis of the joke and how it relates to class and Hustler further
strengthens the social analysis of the publication.  A brief history of publisher Larry Flynt
outlines some of the social issues like Freedom of Speech and Press and unjust legal system
that eventually find their way onto Hustler's pages.
<P>
An analysis of the Jacqueline Onassis nudes and their relationship to 'Beaver Hunt' is an 
example of violating the rigid social distinctions of class hierarchy.
<P>
In conclusion, a theory of representation that conflates bodily representations with real bodies 
and symbolic sex and violence with real sex or violence is needed for adequately criticizing
Hustler.  Hustler itself is irreverent comment on bourgeois sensibilities and a countercultural
force,ultural force, but it is muddled, banal, inconsistent and often distastefully stupid.  With a
substantial circulation this maniacal voice of discontent should be studied and understood.

<H3>4) Comments:</H3>
Laura Kipnis is a sensitive and thoughtful writer about a delicate and controversial subject.
As a c a delicate and controversial subject.
As a critique, I'd first not give Hustler such credit for disclosing attributes of the 
human body. Hustler seems to have only added moisture and the full page genital blow-up
concept.  Even this although not publish in mass circulation was done in the art circles.
<P>
Kipnis is very accurate about the inconsistency of Hustler. This could be a semiotic
message to try and bring credibility to the publication in the eyes of the disillusioned
and disenfranchised who see the world this way.  Juxtapose the consistent messages, anti-smoking, 
children are in danger and anti-war against muddle and flesh, a power statement emerges.  Did this
happen by chance or is  by chance or is this the likely product of blue collar rage?  Larry Flynt may hate
women but probably no more he hates anything else, including himself.
