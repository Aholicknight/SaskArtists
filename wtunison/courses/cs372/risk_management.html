<h1>Risk Management</h1>
<p>The practice of identifying and controlling the many events and situations
which could lead to project failure.

<h2><u>Classical Risk Checklist for Software Projects</u> (Pressman, p. 135)</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Product size:</b> risks associated with the overall size of the software to be
    built or modified.
    <li><b>Business impact:</b> risks associated with constraints imposed by management
    or the marketplace.
    <li><b>Customer characteristics:</b> risks associated with the sophistication of the
    customer and the developer's ability to communicate with the customer in a timely manner.
    <li><b>Process definition:</b> risks associated with the degree to which the software process
    has been defined and is followed by the development organization.
    <li><b>Development environment:</b> risks associated with the availability and quality
    of the tools to be used to build the product.
    <li><b>Technology to be built:</b> risks associated with the complexity of the system to
    be built and the "newness" of the technology that is packaged by the system.
    <li><b>Staff size and experience:</b> risks associated with the overall technical and 
    project experience of the software engineers who will do the work.
</ul>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Is a defined measurable (particular to the project) which indicates numerically the damage
that a risk could deliver to a project should it take place.  Traditionally impact is a positive
number.

<h3>Probability</h3>
<p>The probability of a risk occurring.

<h3>Risk Value</h3>
<blockquote><pre><font size=3>Risk = Impact * Probability</font></pre></blockquote>
