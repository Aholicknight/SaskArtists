Dear Counselor Clipsham,
<BR><P>
I am writing you this letter as a follow up to my impassioned plea before the 
property control board about a year ago.  At that time I was requesting that the 
practice of the city prosecuting (harassing or abusing) their citizens with 
by-laws when requested by anonymous parties be revised.  It is my view that 
this practice is contrary to our basic rights in common law to face one's 
accuser.  The city also practices discrimination as it prosecutes infractions 
of the by-law only when stimulated by these anonymous calls. 
<P>
In the last several years, I have experienced inspections from Health, Property 
Review, Humane Society, and Fire DepartmentSociety, and Fire Department, all of which I believe are funded 
through the city.  Having passed the Health and Humane Society inspections with 
flying colors (although this did involve time and a certain invasion of privacy) 
the other reviews and resulting orders require action.  Until my demand to 
investigate the processes involved there was a constant investigation by these 
inspection agencies of my life.  This is hvestigation by these 
inspection agencies of my life.  This is harassment.  The Property Review Board 
has demanded that I paint my garage to a higher standard than the painting of 
the house next door to me,  the cost of the painting being $500.  The week 
following the death of my father,  his vehicle parked on my property  was under 
scrutiny and required licensing at a cost of approximately $200.  I have 
received 35 work orders from the Fire Inspector, all of which I have completed 
at this time, at a cost of approximately $14,000.  The Fire Inspector was ordered 
by a municipal court judge to work  judge to work with me on compliance.  The representative 
appearing in court on behalf of the City's Fire Department informally declared, 
'they would rather fight the order than comply as it was not part of their job 
description.  They were too busy for assisting my kind'.  It is interesting that 
I have seen members of these teams in my neighborhood watching the production of 
films and generally wandering around.  One of my long time tenants left because 
they felt that there were men peering into their room from the fire escape.  It 
has been noted by my neighbors and myself that the only persons ever found on our 
fire escapes have been the fire inspectors (this is unannounced and at times of 
the mid day when female students are often preparing to leave for classes).  
I would gladly have any of your workers come and assist me in my small efforts 
of making a better neigh efforts 
of making a better neighborhood and safer dwelling for myself and the tenants 
who share the living spaces with me.  The twith me.  The tone of communication with your workers 
has generally been one of imperative decree  and 'I'm only doing my job; I don't 
care about the results.'
<P>
In comparison I have had inspections from the gas and electrical departments of 
the Government of Saskatchewan.  There have been work orders issued and a climate 
of improvement is set by the inspectors.  The work orders have not proceeded 
without problems but the mutual efforts of contractors, the inspectors and myself 
have led to solutions where all parties have been satisfied and the investment 
in improvement is noticeable to those living in the environment.  What practices 
does the provincial government have that makes them more sensitive to improvement?   
I know that they reacted to my requests to know my accuser.
<P>
To demonstrate the ridiculousness of my plight I will cite one incident that may 
let you understand why I believe my basic rights and personal sanctity are being 
denied.  On April 16, 1994, I participated in an art show in an art show held in the basement of 
the Copper Kettle (formally the Vic Bowling Alley).  The show was titled 
<A HREF="../homepage/isma13c.htm"> Social Spaces </A> and was advertised as five female artists and myself.  During 
the opening of the show we were visited and inspected by first, the Provincial 
liquor inspectorirst, the Provincial 
liquor inspector, second, the City Fire Inspector, and finally the members of the 
Regina City Police (in and out of uniform).  The result of the many inspections 
was the closing of the show during its opening in order to satisfy fire 
regulations regarding the replacement of a light bulb.  As the daughter of 
counselor Mike Badham was one of the female artists involved, and he was present 
at this incident, I believe he could verify the excessive inspection and results 
as I have outlined.
<P>
The city representative (Gerry Ahlers) who dealt with my property incident was 
very congenial and I believe would gladly see policy put in place that would 
secure the trd 
secure the tranquillity of people living in neighborhoods trying to develop a 
better world.  Respect for city government would increase if current technology 
were used and freedom of information applied so that any citizen would know the 
identify of an accuser.  The action I seek is a simple policy that has the city 
take no action unless there is an identifiable complainant.  
<P>
I can be reached at 522-7244 or 781-5040 and will gladly assist you in this 
improvement in freedom.
<P>
Respectfully yours,
