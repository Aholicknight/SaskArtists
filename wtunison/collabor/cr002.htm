<P>"Columbus was startled to find people < quite naked as their mothers bore them >"
"they bear no arms, no know thereof - he wrote - for I showed them swords and
they grapsed them by the blade and cut themselves through ignorance. - After 
further describing them as simple defenseless souls, seemingly without religion,
Columbus observed they < ought to be good servants and of good skill., and would
easily be made Christians." - Nancy Smiler Levinson

"The year began with the tension of wanting to do the right thing to beat
agression.... Those events sent a very clear message:  Hey, this isn't the time fohis isn't the time for
isolation.  It's no time to pull back.  We don't need any more surprises and
days of infamy.  We will continue to exert leadership around the world for
peace." - George Bush, People Weekly, Dec 30/91

"Let us be frank.  From an Islamic legal point of view these people are waging
war against the true state of Palestine, against Islam and Muslims as they also 
did in the gulf war against Iraq.  lims as they also 
did in the gulf war against Iraq.  Bush and his aides are criminals.  They are
moharebeen people who in the eyes of Islam have no value and therefore can be 
struck down.  Their blood is of no further value.  They are the most hated and
loather of people.  Therefore it is up to every individual Muslim to carry out 
the execution of Islamic laws (in this case the execution of Bush and his aides)."
