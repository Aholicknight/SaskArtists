<H1>Prayer for Logical Justice with Mercy</H1>
<P>
Living God, who shines forth in unbounded darkened existence.  It is 
you who give us hope, it is you who create our solutions, it is you 
who show us inner peace.
<P>
Lord Jesus we need your loving grace to heal our wounded world.  The 
tribal strife of Africa and Europe scorching the flesh, architecture 
and land needs your power to restore the calm, the quiet, the fertility.  
From the ashes humble beginnings could glow.  When nature has been 
ravished by human foolishness give the world a new life, breath on it 
with your healing breath.
<P>
Understanding Christ who stood with Moses on the Mountain of 
Transfiguration, help us understand the meaning of what is right 
and wrong.  Let us see the magic and sense the presence of divine power.  
When colours do not matter help us to ignore it.  Wp us to ignore it.  When pain and suffering 
become unbearable and the law is jeopardized help us back on your father’s 
path.
<P>
Loving son of man, Jesus Christ remember those who suffer personally 
whether it be from the bone that makes us stand tall or the blood that 
makes our life continue to ebb and flow let us know how to live with the 
pain.  Relieve our suffering.  Remember those parents whose children are r suffering.  Remember those parents whose children are 
suffering.  Give them all strength and peace.  Let their spirits and 
characters be tempered to fortitude with these blasts strife.
<P>
Holy God, creator of things, let us believe all the mysteries that you 
reveal and guide us to be examples of your creation fit for the kingdom 
external in the heavens where all pray to you as Jesus taught us.
