<P><H2><IMG SRC="../pictures/stcecil.jpg" HEIGHT=300 WIDTH=150 ALIGN=LEFT></IMG><BR>St. Cecilia</H2>St. Cecilia is one of the earliest and highly venerated martyred virgins.  As a rich girl of the Roman empire, she was brought up as a Christian and forced to marry.  Her husband (St. Valerian) was convinced not to consumate the marriage and was baptized as a Christian by Bishop Urban.  Valerian was martyred for debating the merits of Jupiter.  St.  Cecilia was sentenced to suffocate in her own bathroom but miraculously survived.  A Roman soldier attempted to behead her three times but failed.  She died three days later.
In the middle ages, St.  Cecilia was often depicted as singing or playing music to the Lord (as a prayer to maintain her maidenhood).  She is the patron or matron saint of music, musicians, instrument builders and poets.
