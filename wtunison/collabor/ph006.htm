As a performance artwork I had Waldo Patton inside of a Television cabinet.
At the show <A HREF="../homepage/isma13c.htm"> Social Spaces </A> , Waldo tried to engage the viewers in normal
social interaction.  The majority decline to be involved.  Why did this
happen?  When I talk with Waldo about sports, technology, politics, I find
it hard to find an end point.  Waldo's converstaions are always interesting,
informative and laced with non-threatening humour.
<P>
I observed that the few involved with Waldo fell into one of three categories:
<OL>
<LI>Acquaintance of Waldo
<LI><A HREF="tc000.htm">Technological Change Addiction</A>
<LI>Personality capable or likely to have Technological Change Addiction.  
(Opinion based on impression not fact).
</OL>

The important thing to observe was not that a certain type of person was 
engaged but that the majority chose not to be involved.  I concluded that the
masses much prefer the passive system which will not respond to them.  Clearly
the art gallery puta threatening spin on the system, but not enough of a threat 
to alienate such a subset of the viewers.  Thus Interact 
to alienate such a subset of the viewers.  Thus Interactive TV is more work
or committment than the average person is willing to commit or spend on leisure.
