<P> 
One way to explain the self is to place it in the context of a community.
In Canada we are attempting to live in a multi-cultural society respecting 
and accepting (by decree) all forms of rituals, feast, and social practice 
(providing there is no contradiction with the legal system).  Our communities 
are comprised of several delegates from alien tribes and a possible tribe or 
two of our own (First Nations or otherwise).  So in country ordering that our
acceptance of culture lack discrimination, the evolution of an indigenous tribe 
is difficult.  It is weakened when the policy toed when the policy to exclude CHRIST from Christmas is 
encouraged.  It is dysfunctional when vinegar does not react in a baking soda 
environment.
<P>
In this reflection, the modern problem of tribal identification (What is my tribe? 
Where is my tribe? What will my tribe become?) is explored from the point of view 
of an individual struggling with community.  Life is difficult and confusing for
the citizen without a  is difficult and confusing for
the citizen without a tribe.  In past times, banishment often meant death. 
What about the self that can not recognize their tribe?  They are in a constant
state of banishment.  Consider the citizen at odds with the tribe.  The proverbs
are not believed, the rituals are not practiced and the landmarks are missed.  
These citizens could consider banishment a favorable option.  When the warriors 
fight the wrong fight, when the women apply charms like whores and when the wise 
ones utter only rubbish, then the tribe is lost, the tribe is dying, and the tribe 
needs placribe 
needs place in the future.
