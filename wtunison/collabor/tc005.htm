<H2>Orpheus - A Myth of Looking Ahead</H2>
<P>
The myth of Orpheus and Eurydice has been used as the basis of many artistic works.
When the story of Orpheus' tragedy is told again in a new form or media it is often
the herald of a new genre, the beginning of a new era in that art form.  This
heralding quality has a certain metaphoric relationship to the story of the man
who was told that he must look ahead.

Orpheus was one of the great Greek heroes, but unlike the majority of the others, his 
heroics were not achieved through battle.  They were achieved through his musical 
talents.  The origins of Orpheus are believed to be that of a Thracian king.
He was the son of Apollo and his musical talents were so great that it is said
that the trees would follow him when he was in ow him when he was in song.  He was one of the Argonauts,
and on their famous voyage he was responsible for stopping the terrible moving rocks 
and lulling a dragon to sleep.
<P>
Orpheus married a nymph named Eurydice who he loved very much.  One day when Eurydice 
was fleeing from Aristaeus she was biten by a venomous snake and died.  Orpheus
grieved very much for her and descended into the Underworld, where he charmed her and descended into the Underworld, where he charmed Hades 
and Persephone with music into letting Eurydice into returning to earth.  The 
condition of her return was that Orpheus should not look back on Eurydice as she 
followed him out of the Underworld.  Near the end of his journey Orpheus turned 
around to look at his wife only to see her vanish back into death forever.
Orpheus' grief was great and his inconsolable disposition is said to have lead
the Thracian women into tearing him to pieces as they were jealous of his devotion
to but one woman.

<U>Orfeo by Claudio Monteverdi</U>
<P>
Inerdi</U>
<P>
In 1607 Claudio Monteverdi wrote his monumental work, a five act opera called Orfeo.
Many people consider Orfeo to be the first opera.  It is considered important for 
many reasons; firstly, the concept that the music is subservient to the plot
changed not only what was happending in the theatre but also in the musical
community in general.  The lyrics of the opera were paramount in importance, and
thus the recitative was invented.  Monteverdi also considered the music to play an 
important part in setting the dramatic atmosphere, and therefore notated on the
scores exactly which instruments were to play in certain parts.  This was quite
unusual for orchestral music of that day.  The forms of the overture and the musical
interludes were found in this opera.  Finally, Monteverdi was writing the music in the
modern harmonic style using both melody and harmony tonic style using both melody and harmony to further express the contents
of his lyrics.  This was different from the model style which was flourh was flourishing just
twenty years before.  Clearly the baroque era of music was launched at the time 
Orfeo was premiered.

<U>Orfeo ed Euridice by Christoph Willibald Gluck</U>
<P>
Serious reform in music took place in the mid 18th century.  The point at which many 
scholars feel that the baroque era of opera was ended and the classical era begins is 
1762 with the production of Orfeo ed Euridice by Gluck.  This opera abondoned the formal
structure of opera which had grown up over the 150 years since Monteverdi's Orfeo, so 
that placement of aria and recitative was more dependant on the plot then on the 
superficial structure of alternating the famed de capo aria of the baroque period
was altered to the more lyrical songs which we are accustomed to in opera today.
The plot of the opera was expected to move in a realistic and lively manner, and not
be subservient to the vocal gymnastics of the super stars which had grown into the 
opera industry.  The orchestra was expanded and parts were written forere written for the orchestra to 
exemplify both mood and plot within the work of art.  Thus the orchestra became a major
contributor to the opera, not simply an accompaniment.  The chorus reappeared in the opera,
(it had been abandoned for the super stars), and the characters took on a considerably
more realistic role.  Ta considerably
more realistic role.  To listen to the aria "Che faro senza Euridice?" ("What shall I do  
without Euridice?") sums up much of what Gluck accomplished with his opera.  The 
simplicity of the melody supported by the orchestra in a way so uncommon to the baroque era.
Gluck's work hints very much and looks forward to the works of Donazetti, Mozart and Rossini.

<U>Orfeu Negro by Marcel Camus</U>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1960's decade the Cannes Film Festival awarded prizes to three
films, Orfeu Negro by Marcel Camus, Hiroshimo Mon Amour by Alain Resnais, and 400 Blows 
by Francois Truffaut.  This was the beginning of modern cinema.  The French critics who have
been callinhave
been calling for stylistic cinema which would use the media in ways other art forms could
not give expression was realized by these three films.  Cinema was changed for ever.
<P>
Orfeu Negro or "Black Orpheus" was shot in Rio de Janerio on a limited budget.  The old myth 
was altered from that of Greeks to black sub-culture in Rio de Janerio in our modern times.
The naming of the characters remained as it was in the Greek myths.  Orfeu not only had the 
gift of song but was also a dancer.  His songs charmed young and old alike and it was said 
that his songs made the sun rise in the morning.  In "Black Orpheus", the dancing of 
Orpheus was awarded the carnival prize.  It was surrounded by popularity.  The modernization
of the story was furthered by having the ven story was furthered by having the venomous snake replaced by electrical cable.  In the
beginning of the film we are forewarned of the electrical power as the cable of the street
car emitts a loud noise and a spark flies showing us the power containedr contained within.  When Eyridice
is pursued through the carnival and into the trolley depot she eventually finds her way to the
cables which she graps and is thus electrocuted.  The strong metaphors are a forwarning of the 
symbolism used by European greats such as Felini and Bergman in modern cinema.  Instead of 
emerging into Hades or the Underworld, Orpheus finds his way to the underground culture of 
voodoo in Rio de Janerio.  The scene portrayed of his contacting Orpheus is very documentary 
in nature.  Unlike the myth Orpheus does not have to charm Hades or Persephone in order
to gain Eyridice.  The ceremony carries him so that he is quite helpless in what appears to
be a real-life situation.  As in the myth, Orpheus looks back and loses Eyridice, and as he 
returns with her body to his mountainous suburb he is attacked by a jealous woman and killed
as he topples over the side onto a sharp cactus.
<P>
The technology of the film making did not look back as Orpheus did, the invention of the hand 
helde hand 
held 16 mm movie camera allowed for the creation of lower budget movies.  Documentary subjects,
which before had not been attempted were possible, and the integration of those subjects
into dramatic works be subjects
into dramatic works became a reality which we are all familiar with today.  "Black Orpheus" was
one of the leaders of this genre.  During the chase of Eyridice's scene, simple lighting 
techniques were used to give an appearance of the characters running in limbo.  The 
techniques can be easily replicated in a studio with limited lighting abilities.  The voodoo
scene and the carnival scenes were very documenatary in nature.  The staging if there was
any would have been very subject to the movements of the performers.  The creation of the new
smaller and inexpensive film media altered the economics of film making to such a degree that 
subject matter could be gathered for use in the production sub-title conclusion.  The
myth of Orpheus has been used in other examples such as Jacque OffenbJacque Offenbach "Orpheus in the
Underworld" which to many is considered the first modern musical.  Examples of Monteverdi
and Gluck and Camus further point out to us at a time when the style of an art form is about to
change.  A monumental work appears on the subject of Orpheus to alert us to look ahead 
there is more to come in the case of "Black Orpheus" we have seen in less than thirty years
the development of an international cinema, a complete revolution in form totally discarding
the theatrical principles of Aristotle.  Economic and technical innovations which have 
broadened the possible subject matter and interpretation thereof.  Orpheus is no longe thereof.  Orpheus is no longer limited
in space to Greece in time to antiquity, but he still must keep looking ahead.
