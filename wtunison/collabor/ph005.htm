<H1>Good Men Versus Good Sex</H1>
<P>
The other night I ran into, well, let's call him Steve.  I had 
known Steve for awhile, I had enjoyed his company before and at 
the end of the evening we ended up in my bed once again.  The 
earth didn't just move - the universe was knocked off kilter.
<P>
Flowers did not follow the next day.  The only phone calls were 
from my mother and my dental hygienist.
<P>
From previous experiences with Steve this wasn't exactly a 
surprise, but I live in hope.
<P>
Since I wasn't occupied arranging flowers or busy making sparks 
fly over the telephone wires I had time to muse about past lovers 
with an attentive girl bunnyrab called Celie.  Little One knows 
all about me and has watched the men that have made it through 
my door, sometimes with interest, other times with amusement.
<P>
I have gone out with "nice" men.  The menith "nice" men.  The men that take the time to 
phone you, take you out and acknowledge your existence on the 
planet if you spend a night making love.
<P>
I know life isn't fair.  But the rotters, the ones that never 
call are the ones that make me moan, make me laugh, make my 
spine tingle.  Frequently, if they don't have coffee and bolt, 
they are quite creative in the kitchen.
<P>
For some God knows why reasonste creative in the kitchen.
<P>
For some God knows why reasons (God is a man) the men that are 
educated and considerate, that are loving and caring, are 
absolute gems in the outside world (you can even take them 
home to Mother) are duds in the bedroom.
<P>
The rotters who are erotic, spontaneous and creative do not want 
to be tied down to a woman, a steady job or a mortgage.
<P>
The nice men who are reliable, have good jobs and RRSP's can only 
put you to sleep in the bedroom.
<P>
Celie is a good listener, her little pink eyes shine brightly, 
understanding the dilemma I am in.
<P>
It seemslemma I am in.
<P>
It seems that you can't have both - either a good man or a good 
sex.  Perhaps I'll follow in the footsteps of a favourite aunt 
of mine and forget about men.
<P>
Bunnies are good company.
