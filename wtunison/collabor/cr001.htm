<H1>Toward an Integrated Film Theory</H1>
<P>
As film makers, artists and enthusiasts, we hold cinematic work in high esteem.  We search
for meanings, analysis, techniques and their effects while enjoying one of the most complex
art forms.  In classical days (pre 1960's) film could be analyzed as discreet units (frame, 
shot or the scene) with bounded understanding of the srtistic whole.  Alternately, the 
analytical techniques of literature and drama could be applied (with suitable augmentation) 
for results not always suitable for the necessary feedback for artistic growth.  Auteur 
Theory appears to approach a work as a triump of an artist over his material.  The personal
motifs and signatures are amplified to a point of exaggeration.  The focus had left the work 
for the creator.  The theory of film evolved back to concentrating on the film itself withilm itself with 
the introduction of the first and second semiotics.  A language of cinema is proposed which
places film on a more scientific basis.  The work of Christian Metz is the basis of this
semiotics.  From this basis enhancements based on symbols, linquistics and psychoanalysis 
are introduced.  Current advances seem to focus on the spectator.  What is perceived?  Can a 
film represent a true feeling of a minoritym represent a true feeling of a minority.  So for thirty years we have pulled our
theoretical attention from the creator, to the product, to the consumer.  Has all of this
activity given us a general approach to film?  Perhaps so.  This paper is an attempt to
formulate a theory of film based on the modern film theories and basic communication theory.
<P>
<H3><U>Communication and Film Theory</U></H3>
<P>
If we look at communication in its pure and basic form we have a three element model:  Sender, 
message, receiver.  The sender sends a message which is received byt he receiver totally.  
Thertally.  
There is a complete one-to-one correspondence of the sent message and the received message.
<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/cr00101.jpg">
<P>
Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world, therefore it is normal for the receiver
to not only receive the message but noise as well.  The noise may hamper the receiver from 
receiving the total message.  This leads us to a model that is no longer in balance.
<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/cr00102.jpg">
<P>
Our purpose is not to develop a theory of communications or even linguistics but one for film.
The theory is based on the communications model and the theories mentioned previously.  The
sender is assumed to be an auteur, the message a text and the receiver a spectator.

<P>
<H3><U>Auteur</U></H3>
<P>
From the 'Theory of Auteurism' we draw a purpose in defining the auteureurism' we draw a purpose in defining the auteur not in the pure 
traditional sense (although compatible) but in terms of semiotics.  The purpose is two fourpose is two fold:
to understand the creator of the text, and eliminate the trivial from our discussion.  The 
auteur is a prophetic craftsman, a distinguishable personality and a creator of inner meaning.
Andrew Sarris describes 'the auteur theory emphasizes the body of a director's work rather than
isolated masterpieces'.  The auteur theory is a classification system describing the auteur
and his collective work.
<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/cr00104.jpg">
<P>
If we draw on the theory of semiotics we can further articulate the auteur and his work.
Christian Metz describes two categories (or axis) of cinematic text.  the first is the 
syntagmatic or the narrative line.  'it is the syntagmatic considerations that are at the
center of the problems of filmic denotation.  Although each image is a free creation, the
arrangement of these images into an intelligible sequence - cutting and montage - brings us
to the heart of the semiological dimension of file.'
<P>
The other being the paradigmatic or symbolic axis.  Umbelic axis.  Umberto Eco describes the language of the 
paradigmatic category.  'It carries preexisting codes and it is carried by its own specific
codes.  Sometimes it establishes new codes and often these new correlations produced by a 
given film will not be accepted by cinema.'
<P>
Thus an auteur must work on both'
<P>
Thus an auteur must work on both the Paradigmatic and Syntagmatic axises even if it is
purposely to ignore one or the other.
<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/cr00105.jpg">
<P>
It is important to describe the auteur and his work in the light of auteurism in order to
assess the intended text communicated.  The complexity of film is such that it is possible 
to receive a text dramatically different from the one sent.  By understanding the auteur
we hold a better chance of receiving the intended text.
<P>
<H3><U>Text</U></H3>
<P>
The term text is used to describe a set of images (video or audio) that create a message (or
even an inner meaning).  The concept of text is hierarchical where a high terchical where a high text can be composed
of lower texts (and possibly augmented with images).  For example in Fellini's 8 1/2 we have a
text concerning the pomp and oppression of the church of Rome. This text is made up of other
texts:  the interview with the cardinal, the pre-interview discussions, the parade of clery
and the punishment for indiscretion with the fat lady.  Each text is a text on its own and
contributes to a greater text.
<P>
Texts come in many forms, the study of these forms falls back to the disciplines of dramatic,
artistic and literacy criticism augmented with an understanding of montage and the film theories
of Kracauer and Bazin.
<P>
To use the semiotic model to exemplify some of the possible textual analysis we look at text on 
the syntagmxtual analysis we look at text on 
the syntagmatic axis:
<P>
<U><Strong>Direct Text:</Strong></U> image without symbolic interpretation.
<P>example:  the policeman returns Orphan Annie to Miss Hannagan after she ran away from the orphanage.  (Houston's, Age.  (Houston's, Annie).
<P>
<U><Strong>Mediated Text:</Strong></U> an interpretation of the text is presented.
<P>example:  Alex explains in A Clockwork Orange 'This is the real weepy and tragic part of the story beginning now, oh my friends' (Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange).
<P>
<U><Strong>Complementary Text:</Strong></U> presentation of the negative.
<P>example:  The song 'If You Could See Her Through My Eyes' she wouldn't look Jewish at all (Fosse's, Cabaret).
<P>
The techniques for storytelling are varied and elaborate, it is enough to say that the codification
can be completed where the detail is necessary.
<P>
The paradigmatic axis offeres further classification and cross reference.  In the case of 
symbolism the book is still open on ways of representing images.  Thus we can build texts
on the paradigmatic axis with symbolic images (video or audio).
<P>example:
<UL>broken locket=> family ties (Houston's, Annie)</UL>
<UL>pet snake=> Alex's manhood (Kubrick's, A Clockwork Orange)</UL>
<UL>money=>personal pmoney=>personal prostitution (Fosse's, Cabaret)</UL>
<P>
Thus we have a system of placing a text on the semiotic plane by evaluating its narrative
and symbolic qualities.
<P>
Now, there is an additional concept ties.
<P>
Now, there is an additional concept that links back to the auteur.  The intent can be intended
(IT) (by deliberate design of the auteur) or unintended (UT) (perceived but not part of the 
design of the auteur).  The intended text is like the message while the unintended text is noise.
<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/cr00106.jpg">
<P>
<H3><U>Spectator</U></H3>
<P>Modern thought places importance on the spectator as a vital part of the film process.  The
psychological and social  basis of film are noted to place the film on an individual basis with 
the spectator.  Psychology is usually based on Freudian ideas expounded by the feminist critics
while the social analysis draws on Marxist notions of ideology and structure.
<P>
<H3><U>Psychoanalysis</U></H3>
<P>This approach to a film places the speo a film places the spectator at the position of the camera.  From this 
vantage point, he is an act of perception.  He is the priviledged voyeur who is safe to 
witness the incredible and unthinkable.
<P>
<H3><U>Feminist Analysis</U></H3>
<P>Laura Mulrey takes the psychoanalytical approach, further by labelling the act of 
witnessing as 'Visual Pleasure'.  This is based on the concept of viewing another as an 
erotic object.  Another pleasure is invoked by vicariously identifying with the male 
character who is in control.  Finally, the image of women can be threatening when representing
a castrated being.  Lucy Fischer points out that females can view these male texts, t that females can view these male texts, enjoy them
but have limited room for positive identification.
<P>
<H3><U>Social Spectatorship</U></H3>
<P>To believe that females are the only people with limitations for identification would be
naive if not bigoted.  Film makers of racial minorities (Britain) are exploring the craft
to create a cinema with aa cinema with a higher affinity to their minority audience.  Criticism of this work 
is founded on Marxist philosophies.  The need to reject many of the symbols and conventions
of cultural imperialism gives justification for texts previously rejected.  The rules are
written once again.
<P>
<H3><U>Evaluation of Spectator Affinity</U></H3>
<P>Spectator can react in one of four ways:
<UL>Accept</UL>
<UL>Neglect</UL>
<UL>Reject</UL>
<UL>Negotiate</UL>
<P>
To quantify the ability to and likelihood of a reaction the following profile analysis
is offered as a model:
<P>
If the spectator has no common areas with the film then he will neglect the film.  If 
the common areas are in opposition then he will reject the film.  If the common areas 
are similar then he will accept the film.  Finally, if the common area are opposed and 
similar then a negotiation with the film can take place.
<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/cr00107.jpg">
<P>To illustrate the evaluation process the author of this paper is the sample spectator ag sample spectator against four films.
<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/cr00108.jpg">
<P>
As a spectator I could accepictures/cr00108.jpg">
<P>
As a spectator I could accept Cabaret and A Clockwork Orange, neglect Cannonball Run
and negotiate with Annie.  To negotiate a reading of the film Annie may seem unbelievable
but yet it is true.  The upper class heart toward clean little Annie was overpowering 
the slight interest in New York geography that I had.  My young daughter forced repeated
viewings on me until I not only appreciated the music but much of the text.  To me this
was a perfect example of the negotiation described by Homi K. Bhabha: "the act of 
negotiation will only be interrogatory.  Can such split subjects and differentiated 
social movements, which display ambivalent and divided forms of identification, be 
represented in a 'collective will' .... How does the language of the will accommodate
the vicissitudes of its representation, which is its construction through a symbolic
majority where the have-notswhere the have-nots identify themselves from the position of the haves?".
<P>So what could have been a rejected film becomes negotiated acceptance.
<P>The problem facing the spectator is the accuracy that he receives the texts.  
When the common areas are in opposition there is a tendancy to receive texts (UT) rather
than the intended (IT).
<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/cr00109.jpg">
<P>
When the common areas are not similarily matched, the capture ratios (X%) drops.
<P>
<H3><U>Summary</U></H3>
This integrated theory gives the film maker a structure for self examination, theer a structure for self examination, the 
critic a comprehensive quantitative system to measure the work and the audience an
understanding of their tastes.  When applied we look at the content of the film,
try to understand the intent and the reception of the content by the spectator.
