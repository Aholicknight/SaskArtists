<H1>Purification of Violence</H1>
<P>Is a scorched earth a fertile ground?  The dilemma that faces so many of us
seems to be (possibly necessary) 'Is a certain amount of violence good' or 
maybe 'Violence itself is obtaining virtuous attributes'.
<P>
Spare the rod and spoil the child (Proverbs 13:24).  Star Wars rhetoric about global
peace obtained through the presence and most likely the demonstration of hideous
destructive power.  In my home province the police will forceably remove a man 
from his home if it is alleged that he was violent.  Will a cultural blossoming 
bloom out of Palestine, Bosnia, or Cambodia?

In Italy, for 30 years out of the bourgeois they had warfare, terror, murder,
bloodshed but they produced Michaelangelo, Leonardo de Vinci aneonardo de Vinci and the
Renaissance.  In Switzerland, they had brotherly love.  They had 500
years of democracy and peace and what did that produce?  The cuckoo
clock.

In South Africa a convicted terrorist and promoter of violence
now rules the government.  Nelson Mandela should be credited with
the execution of the amnesty for his former persecutors.  Murderers and 
torturers are walking free because   Murderers and 
torturers are walking free because a visionary said 'Enough Violence', 'Time
to Build', 'I'm free, you should be free'.  In Canada a young rapist/murderer
under the age of 16 will walk into adulthood with no baggage of his/her crime
except personal guilt.
<P>
Maybe violence is like alcohol, a little makes life more pleasant, too much
can make life hell.  Maybe violence is age dependant.  Violence is definitely
sensitive to race and gender.
