<HR>
<P>
Sometimes my life is black.<BR>
The light shutters my energy.<BR>
All seems emblematic of despair and anguish.<BR> 
I fear success more than staying in my wretched state. <BR>
I am paralyzed by the comfort of my role as prisoner and victim.<BR>
I can not imagine the splendor of calm that your eternal love generates.<BR>
These times of change lay opportunity at my feet<BR>
yet the path seems steep, the valley dark and wide, <BR>
and my life an oasis in the desert of others. <BR>
God keep my healthy, <BR>
let me prudently help others and join the mysteries of your way.  <BR>
Speak to me and use me as an act for your glory.<BR>
<P>
Magic.  Is there no miracle that you do not perform?  <BR>
Are your revelations always so far reations always so far reaching?  <BR>
Space, biotechnology, medicine, and the dynamics of man.  <BR>
So many wonder as the light of your knowledge shines on them.  <BR>
They are consumed with fear, stress, and bewilderment.  <BR>
They can not see that they can join the dance.  <BR>
They forget that with you, all walk, jump and be together as those dry bones.  <BR>
Let them hear Ezekiel's words.  <BR>
Let them make the ch
Let them hear Ezekiel's words.  <BR>
Let them make the change and rise from their grave of dark to the light of your holy way.<BR>
We pray for them.
<P>
God of Glory, giver of wisdom whose power shows us how to fly, <BR>
see through walls and the past of a man's self.  <BR>
As your power caresses our being let us know how to use it to glorify your name.  <BR>
It is natural for us to doubt but when we act, <BR>
trust and see the possibilities of your ever evolving way let us shine for your glory.  <BR>
Remove our fear, heal our wounds, dry our tears <BR>
and let us believe in the marvelous possibile marvelous possibilities of your promises to us <BR>
which we now acknowledge <BR>
as we pray to you say the words taught by your son Jesus Christ.
