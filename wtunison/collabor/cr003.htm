<H1>Godiva Rides</H1>
<P>
When researching the history of the PRANK known as the Godiva Ride,
I observed several elements of ritual that intrigued me about my 
profession and colleagues in engineering.
<P>
The first and most blatant of the ritualistic needs served in the
elevation of an animalistic desire into something socially acceptable.
The majority of the engineering students and professors are male and 
logically appreciate the sight of a naked woman.  Within the 
engineering community the spirit of jest and mischief shrouded
with the intense secrecy and planning jargon are the acceptable
ways of approaching the event.  Outside the engineering sub
culture, particularly among the professors a politically correct
amnesia infects the majority of the participants.
<P>
The potential for the feeling of unworthiness in the non-participants
is great.  Many liberal artseat.  Many liberal arts students are aghast at the spectacle
of the woman on the horse invading their space with tonque-in-check
anachronism.  The engineering student has drawn reference to a 
historical event of civil disobedience with gender and religious
implications.  The engineer has planned, directed and executed
performance art on a significant scale (woman, horse, parade of 
engineers).  All of this accomplishmenhorse, parade of 
engineers).  All of this accomplishment makes the student of the 
liberal arts envious.  They think "Why can't my debating society
build a distillation system?" or "Why doesn't my Women's Centre fix
cars?".
<P>
The most elegant historical reference is the relationship with viewing
the ritual and the character 'Tom'.  It is said that 'Tom' gazed on
Lady Godiva inappropriately (voyeurism, not in the spirit of protest)
and thus had his eyes dashed out.  The viewer, who is unable to seize
the spirit of the occasion, is infuriated because of the logical
linkage to Tom and the subconscom and the subconscious feeling that their eyes should,
could or have been violated.  It is thus with guilt and/or 
unworthiness that opposition to the Lady Godiva ride is gathered.
<P>
The Godiva Rides are banned or voluntarily discontinued for the 
sake of female engineering students.  The systematic decision
seemed to have little relevance to the female engineering students
I've talked to or the former Lady Godivas (who were saddened by
its decline).

The Lady Godiva ride is a long standing tradition of the university engineering 
student.  The psychology of the people involved in such events is explored through 
the telling of urban legend and personnal reflection.  Godiva ride footage and 
stills are intercut with the disclosures to form a unified tale of frivolity and 
discovery.</P>
