<H1>Prepuberty to Reality</H1>
<P>
I was in a fashion show when I was four.  I had big blue eyes, dimples,
and naturally curly hair.
<P>
When I was growing up there were movie magazines like Silver Screen.  All 
the movie stars had beautiful hour glass figures.
<P>
My idol was Elizabeth Taylor.  She was so beautiful.  She looked so fantastic.
<P>
My first BIG LIE was that after puberty I would look like her or one
of the other women with beautiful bodies.  I just had to wait for this
magical thing called puberty.  I'd develop breasts, have a small waist and
alluring hips.
<P>
It never happened. Unlike my sister who wears a C-cup, my breats are small,
my waist could be smaller and my hips have never attracted a man's attention.
That was the first BIG LIE.
<P>
It was followed by:
<UL>
<LI>A university education will get you a job
<LI>Nice girls don't get ra<LI>Nice girls don't get raped
<LI>The banks work for you!
</UL>
<P>
So make good friends and create your own reality.
