<H1>Rituals as Useful Functions in Society</H4>
<P>
The portrayal of ritual in the prologue is mostly from a negative point
of view.  Rituals do serve some very useful functions in society.  Apart
from the exercise of animal needs, humans have a need to express the
spiritual side of who we are.  Spirituality is one of the more difficult
practices in our culture.  Because spirituality doesn't connect well
with intellect, nor does it "produce" anything tangible or directly
saleable, we have a tough time dealing with it.  The human spirit
connects with where we find meaning in life, how we understand death,
how we connect with infinity, how we relate to each other, the richness
of our emotions, among other things.  These agenda are best touched and
rehearsed in ritual.  Through ritual, we connect with the stories and
the people that touch our spirihat touch our spirits.
<P>In rituals we form community.  This can be as obvious as the ritual of
disagreement with an umpire when the call goes against the home team or
as subtle as reciting a creed that connects us with some people and
differentiates us from others.  Rituals around death help us to make
some sense out of what doesn't make sense in the framework in which we
normally operate.  Rituals give us anchors in o
normally operate.  Rituals give us anchors in our lives, as points of
contact with realities beyond ourselves and as events that occur with
regularity, on which we can count.  One of the easiest ways to get a
Church to go into a fight is to change the time of the weekly service of
worship.  When people don't think they can count on things to be the
same forever, their lives feel out of whack somehow.  Why else would we
have people sitting in the same pews for 40 years in Churches that are
less than half full.  Any attempt to unity a dozen struggling churches
into a couple of vital ones is doometal ones is doomed to immediate failure.
<P>Rituals have a function of telling us who we are and where we fit in
reality.  They can serve evil and destructive purposes, but also
creative and vital purposes.
