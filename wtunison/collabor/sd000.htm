I personally feel that society and individuals in our society do not want me to ever
reach a state of inner peace.  They watch my spending.  Why did you spend $12.81 at 
the IGA?  They consider how bright the lights are in the hallway.  Is it safe in 
those dark corridors? 
<P>
Inner peace is achieved by following one or more prescribed paths of good 
living.  On such a path is the fullfillment of a <A HREF="sd003.htm">pact with 
the supreme deity</A>
as a good person.  This often requires a display of prudence, self sacrifice,
regular prayer and adherance to a code of conherance to a code of conduct.  Our environment creates
conflict with such life styles. Sometimes there is supression of rituals, 
other times food laws become difficult to uphold, and still other times the 
ability to avoid the taboo or unacceptable is impossible.

<H3>Quote from <I>CALL IT SLEEP</I> by Henry Roth, Copyright 1928</H3>
And at noon, he had quarreled with Ruchel, his 
daughter, over the chicanhe had quarreled with Ruchel, his 
daughter, over the chicanery of her husband, Avrum, 
the butcher.  Cold-storage liver he was selling and 
palming it off for fresh.  <A HREF="sd001.htm">A snide generation</A>.  Why should 
the children be better than their fathers?  No sanctity 
anywhere, no faith.  It's kosher, she said.  Ruchel his 
daughter, his thorn.  It tastes just as good. In food
there should be some trust, he had answered.  If you 
were selling walking sticks sell the flawed, the warped, 
the brittle.  Say nothing, tell nothing.  But what enters 
the mouth, there you must betray no trust. t betray no trust.  If you're 
selling "treifes" say it is "treife" and men will hold 
you a man.  If you're selling cold-storage for fresh- 
But it's kosher, she had said.  Of couse it's kosher, he 
had answered.  Liver is kosher till it rots.  It needs no 
washing before the third day.  No salting.  Even a goy 
knows that.  Hi! Hi! My daugheter, my daughter! It's 
good.  It tastes good you say.  There was a Jew traveling 
toward Odessa and he ate in an inn without knowing 
what he ate.  Good beef he called it. Savory gravy.  And 
they told him-what?  They told him it was horsemeat. 
And hi-hi-hi my daughter, if he's not vomiting 
up the green gall to this very day, it's only because he's,
dead.  And so with you my daughter - it tastes good. 
And how far is the step from cold storage meat to 
meat not kosher and how far is the step from meat not 
kosher to pig's flesh?s the step from meat not 
kosher to pig's flesh? Hi! Hi! Hi! My daughter! You'll 
drive me into the deep earth with a weight of shame. 
May ight of shame. 
May your head drop off from your shoulders, and 
your husband's head beside it.  My Daughter . . . <BR>
Hi . . . An evil day. . . <BR>

<P>What I would propose is that the level of surveillance be 
heightened so that everyone is under the <A HREF="http://www.paleface.com/midnight/cvfree.html">watchful eye of the general public</A>.
The public would watch the president when he was with Thelma, Delores, Paula or Harriette
and would witness any dirty deed or lack of indiscretion.  The queen or princess
of whatever could strut their stuff for all to see and everyone would see royalty
only twist the basics a little from the common man. 
<A HREF="http://pathfinder.com/@@bDDhsgYAX5T0upPl/people/weekly/contents.html">
People magazine</A> already does
some of this within bounds (some 
<A HREF="http://www.csleuth.com/gallery.html">
celebrities</A> can not take the scrutiny but what if 
it was the norm).  If I came across a rapist or other violent person on the scrutiny
net I would alert the cybld alert the cyberpolice and they could deny them of the freedom to act
violently.  The <A HREF="sd002.htm">eye of the public should be on all</A> and ever watchful at this level
field anyone could seek their own personal sanctity.
