<H1>Meditations on Transfiguration</H1>
The story of Elijah and the chariot of fire and the incident on 
the mount of Transfiguration are two examples of everyday people 
experiencing the glory of god in ways that are not explainable through 
science.
<P>
This glory is around us at all times.  The splendor of a summer 
thunderstorm or haunting white out of a blizzard are just two examples. 
 How should we react to such tales and what do they mean to us today?
<P>
When I consider my Teutonic roots, what reaction would a Viking 
ancestor have of such accounts.  First of all he would have a 
stronger kinship with a world filled with magic.  I define magic 
as an act of pulling or observing a possibility from the well of 
potential into being an act of creation.  All of this comes in being 
from the Unmanifest.  The manifest being all things that are seen, ings that are seen, 
touched, perceived, manipulated, imagined or understood.  The Unmanifest 
is all that is not manifest.  Magical everyday occurrences would be the 
beauty of sunrise, a completely unpremeditated generous loving act or the 
sense of absolute inner peace.  The same circumstances do not always lead 
to the same magical result which means the magic is unpredictable, 
unrepeatable and unexplainable.
<P>npredictable, 
unrepeatable and unexplainable.
<P>
The Vikings knew there was magic in this world from this knowledge 
he could easily accept the Christian theology and the tribe settled 
into a more peaceful existence.  Since that conversion science, 
philosophy and the spirit of enlightenment have jaded our approach 
to most things but particularly magic.  We think of tricksters, carnival 
hustlers and the dark side of humanity.
<P>
Mark describes a transfiguration witnessed by 3 men Peter, James and John.
  The event happened before their eyes as Jesus assumed the shining 
garments symboliining 
garments symbolizing that the Messianic era was beginning.  The venue 
for the mystery was a mountain veiled in cloud just as God gave the law 
to man through Moses.  Moses appears as a noble statesman of those who 
experienced transfiguration.  His presence reminds us of the law, a gift 
from God that when it is followed leads to a high quality of life.  Elijah 
also appears a prophet, a mouth piece for God.  Elijah was a man driven in 
his service to God and stood up against the designs of men with fortitude 
and courage.  Moses and Elijah brought elements of magic by their presence 
and previous experience.
<P>
If the elements of magic are ignored and replaced with man made constructs 
stability is reduced and there is even less logic.  Without all dimensions 
of the light and meaning, minds are not open to all knowledge.  The law 
will disintrigrate so that the man he law 
will disintrigrate so that the man found innocent must pay the damages, or 
death with malice and debauchery is a lesser crime than dsser crime than death with 
misguided love.  The prophets voice is weakened and the priest of Baal, 
Voltaire and Gates capture our hearts.  Interesting great thinkers and 
scientists such as Einstein accepted that there were unexplained mysteries 
and their faith was strengthened.  Most of all without the resulting faith 
that comes through the logical extension of the witness to magic we are 
less enabled to experience the true rapture ever present in the love of 
Christ.
