    The myth seems to have started in 1980 in Berrien Springs,
    Michigan.<br>
    <br>
    Since then, false warnings about "Blue Star" LSD tattoos and
    their ability to cause fatal "trips" among children have spread
    across the continent like a recurring viral infection, raising
    panic at each outbreak.
