<H1>First Lady Rips Quilt</H1>
<P>How much of the Canadian tax payers dollar has the CBC wasted on 
documenting the life and justifying the bad behaviour of certain politicians
errant wives?  
<P><i>Later, when someone asked him about the quilt and his ardent supporters in 
New York, he replied "Reason over passion; that's the theme of all my writings."
Joyce was pleased to have yet another quote and concluded that he took it all seriously.  In later years, when Trudeau was married, legend has it that his
wife Margaret tore the letters from the quilt when they were having a fight, "presumably in 
an effort to re-arrange her husband's priorities."
