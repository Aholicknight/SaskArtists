                <br>
                enters less. The stump of her leg lies withered beside her
                <br>
                uncovered sex--stretched tightly over the jutting ridges
                <br>
                of her pelvis. All the light of the room is devoured by the
                <br>
                hungry eyes of the children. Hers, fixed, empty, half-open,
                <br>
                gasp at the darkness as it pours in, filling her. The long
                <br>
                waiting leading to these massive, corroding seconds is almost
                <br>
                over, the one leading away almost begun. Her last breaths
                <br>
                are exhaled directly into the distant mouths of the children. Their
                <br>
                organs writhe, seeking to break their frozen bodies into motion
                <br>
                that will not come. Movement is hardly possible under the great
                <br>
                weight of this waiting.
