<B>Intensive repetition or chanting of a word will cause<BR>
 its meaning to alter and shift / Filth / Filth / Filthy ones.<BR>
 Also, when conjoined as a universal adjective or adverb<BR>
 it will cease to be of any effect / Filthy love / Filthy hate<BR>
 / Filthy joy / Filthy fear / Filthy rage / Filthy thoughts /<BR>
 Filthy memories / Filthy rooms / Filthy bodies / Filthy <BR>

<B>In isolation from all others, mirroring only itself, its<BR>
 meaning is empty, its power lost, its dangerous abilities<BR>
 rendered impotent / however, the vacuum thus created<BR>
 begins to suck away all other meaning and significance / <BR>
once incited, the consumption proceeds unstoppably, in<BR>
 geometric progression, dissolving great patches of infinitude<BR>

<B>The body of my mother, Marguerite, implodes. Pressure<BR>
from the eyes of the grieving children and the<BR>
weight of the hot, still air squeeze the skin down between<BR>
her ribs and tighten it around her bones. Each<BR>
breath, her mouth gaping and dried, escapes more fully,<BR>
enters less. The stump of her leg lies withered beside her<BR>
uncovered sex--stretched tightly over the jutting ridges<BR>
of her pelvis. All the light of the room is devoured by the<BR>
hungry eyes of the children. Hers, fixed, empty, half-open,<BR>
gasp at the darkness as it pours in, filling her. The long<BR>
waiting leading to these massive, corroding seconds is almost<BR>
over, the one leading away almost begun. Her last breaths<BR>
are exhaled directly into the distant mouths of the children. Their<BR>
organs writhe, seeking to break their frozen bodies into motion <BR>
that will not come. Movement is hardly possible under the great<BR>
weight of this waiting.<BR></B>
