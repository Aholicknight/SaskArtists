"Children Shining on the Moon"</H3>
<H4><P>
Witiko lives in the North<BR>
Witiko lives in the Wind<BR>
Witiko's gift is the Wind<BR>
<P>
Witiko's voice howls and cuts<BR>
Witiko kills the father's eyes<BR>
Witiko slices the mother's tongue<BR>
<P>
And children whirl like lost chicks<BR> 
like when the grouse hen is dead and eaten<BR>
<P>
the wind blows hard and cold<BR>
Witiko screams and tears up the land<BR>
Everyone is scattered and blown by the force of it<BR>
<P>
Flying crystals of ice glittering<BR>
The cold white softness of snow<BR>
Screaming, still screaming across the black sky<BR>
<P>
The moon watches, glowing like steel,<BR>
 Quiet and smooth.<BR>
<P>
and the snowdrifts pile up in the alleys<BR>
 where the children got blown <BR>
with the dirt and the garbage<BR>
 trying to hide from the screaming.<BR>
<P>
It doesn't stop.<BR>
<P>
Their beautiful brown skin melts the snow,<BR>
 softens the cold hard glaze on the old men's eyes.<BR>
 and the car door closes.<BR>
Slamming out the moon.<BR>
<P>
Kids turn hard when they learn<BR>
to suck cock for cash,<BR>
hard and soft at the same time.<BR>
 Their gentle glow masked by knives in their  cash,<BR>
hard and soft at the snives in their  cash,<BR>
hard and soft at the same time.<BR>
 Their gentle glow masked by knives in their eyes<BR>
<P>
"Fucker tried to rip me off,<BR>
 rip off my sister and my brother,<BR>
 so I cut him up.<BR>
 I think he shit himself.<BR>
 You should'a seen all the blood,<BR>
 he was fucking spraying it all over."<BR>
<P>
Tough kids laugh at cruelty.<BR>
 Then they look up into the cold black sky,
<BR> They see the moon sewn into the grandmothers'<BR>
 web of stars, and hear its song.<BR>
 Then they shake and cry hot swollen tears that won't stop,<BR>
 until the needle goes in.<BR>
<P>
The boys are eager and hungry<BR>
They stand close to each other<BR></H4>
<P>
<H4>Their traplines on the dark streets<BR>
 uncoiled and faded away.<BR>
 Time to poke up, swim in the heat of the blood,<BR>
 the needle finds a vein and blooms<BR>
 hot and red in its barrel<BR>
<P>
Hungry eyes, eager eyes,<BR>
 the soft brown skin stretched tight like a drum,<BR>
 and their breath is shaking, shaking.<BR>
<P>
He pulls it out and just as fast, faster<BR>
 pokes his friend, his brother, his lover<BR>
 and they poke each other circling,<BR>
 and flying together, harder and faster,<BR>
 expanding inside their trembling bodies<BR>
 and filling the world<BR>
<P>
and each poke is a stab<BR>
 that slices them off<BR>
 killing each other<BR>
<P>
like shadows, the final prints of their bodies in the whiteness,<BR>
 where they lay melting the snow<BR>
 where they were thrown,<BR>
 wheness,<BR>
 where they lay melting the snow<BR>
 where they were thrown,<BR>
 where they lay down softly, in slow motion.<BR>
<P>
and their heat rises from deep inside their ass,<BR>
 deep where the spine is anchored,<BR>
the place where the soul doesn't know itself.<BR>
<P>
Watch that process now<BR>
 because you can<BR>
 because your anchor is not torn out <BR>
and hanging by a bloody shred.<BR>
<P>
Watch the shadows grow to cover their eyes<BR>
 spreading softly across their burning skin.<BR>
 Watch their flesh dissolve<BR>
 until your tears blind you<BR>
 and your crying throat threatens to choke off the air.<BR>
<P>
Witiko screams with laughter and tears up the world<BR>
 Witiko's gift is the wind<BR>
 It lifts the boys out and away<BR>
 rising through the black sky<BR>
 and condenses them softly into the furious brilliance of the moon.<BR>
<P>
Safe and luminous,<BR>
 they finally shine.<BR>
 That peaceful, cold shining<BR>
 that throbs and resonates<BR>
 Singing in our hearts<BR>
 because that light is made of the souls<BR>
 of all the dead children.<BR>
<P>
Their song is sewn gently and with care<BR>
 into the grandmothers' web of stars.<BR></H4>
<P>
<H4>For us, Witiko can only scream with laughter<BR> Watching us pinned down and wiggling<BR>
 scroched by the burden of our nightmares.<BR>
<P>
Witiko lives in the North<BR>
 Witiko lives in theiko lives in the North<BR>

 Witiko screams anditiko's gift is the wind Witiko's voice howls and cuts<BR>

Screaming, still screaming across the black sky,<BR>
<P>
The moon watches,<BR> 
Glowing like steel, quiet and smooth.<BR></H4>
