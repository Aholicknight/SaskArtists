<!--<p>Robin Poitras was born 1958
</p>-->
 
<p>Robin is one of Saskatchewan's most prolific dance and perfomance creators. She has been immersed in contemporary dance practice since the early 80's.</p>
<p>For years she has meshed together formal worlds of dance with perfomance art. Her practices are rooted in a physical world comprised of choreography. She is a interdisiplinary artist often using objects.</p>
<p>Robin collaborates beyond dance as she forms objects and concocts costumes used in her performances. Robin's work has travelled all across Canada; internationally
into France, Germany, Spain, Mongolia, and Mexico. Her close attention in researching diverse fields of artistic and somatic
practices,  have developed a unique style where numerous disciplines are woven into her imaginative approach.</p>
